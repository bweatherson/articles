Thanks to the editor and the reviewers again for helpful comments, and I'm sorry I was so slow getting to this.

I've basically done everything the reviewers asked. 

- The times I wrote '18' rather than '22' were a dumb mistake and I've corrected those. 
- There were a lot of anaphoric pronouns that were very unclear; the reviewers picked up some but when I went back and re-read it looking for similar problems I found a few more. So I spell things out a lot more clearly now rather than saying "that case" or "that view". 
- The last line at the end of section 2 was overstated. I wound it back considerably, and then put some of the nuance in a footnote.
- I've added a few more references to place the paper a little better in the current literature.
- I caught a few more typos and changed them.

But otherwise the paper is largely as it was, apart from correcting the mistakes the reviewers picked up. And I'm very grateful for their help with this.
