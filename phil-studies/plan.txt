# Introducing LDA

Make the graph, link back to start of paper
Describe the five categories
Do just an epistemology vs language graph

# LDA Methodology

Describe method
  - 3 problems: need to select k by hand, randomness and unnatural categories
  - Solution to first: Citations tell us that other topics aren't major part
  - Solution to second and third: pick the model with the best correlation between articles and articles they cite
Crossed articles
  - Clear cases: 
      ethics & epistemology: Kelly (2002); 
      language & epistemology: Stalnaker (2006); 
      mind & metaphysics: Kim ???
  - Messy cases:
      Haslanger (2016)
      Bourget and Chalmers (2009)
  - For many purposes, we'll live with mess; just sum the probabilities
