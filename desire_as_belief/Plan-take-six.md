# Lewis's Proof

Set up the theory V(A) = Pr(A*)
Make the four assumptions
Get to Ittay's version of the objection
Note that Lewis's version doesn't help

## Two Humean Theses

* No necessary connection

What does this even mean?
Just need to have one state with multiple properties
Worry about direction of fit (Smith)
Worry about Frege-Geach problems

* Reason slave of the passions

This is more serious
At least some folks want the explanation to go from Pr to V
Really "Passion not slave of reason" is our slogan

Compare moral uncertaintism
Cite bunch of people
Note that when ZERO-ONE holds, they mostly agree

# Moral Newcomb Problems

Set up the puzzle
Say more than in previous drafts about how it is a puzzle
Crucially, it is the action, not the disposition, that matters

Two options, neither of them helpful
The causalist doesn't buy the additivity assumption
The evidentialist doesn't buy the initial setup
So no one will feel that there is an argument here

# Evidential Moral Decision Theory

Puzzles about conditionalisation
Some discussion about comparison cases where cond fails
Go into some depth on the modelling assumptions
Note that there is an argument lurking

1. Functionalism
2. Conditionalisation
3. Not Constitutive (from 1)
4. Not Evidential (from 2)
5. So not moral decision theory (from 3, 4)

I actually kind of like this argument
But it isn't at all persuasive - premises really strong

# Constitutive Moral Decision Theory

How to get this right is a challenge

# Lewis Exegesis

All to be done

# Alternative Objections to Lewis

Some from blogs, some from notes, some easy once the setup is in place
