# The overgeneration objection

So assume (following Price's last suggestion) that Servant is in charge of a large endowment, and is making investment decisions on behalf of Master. Master, we'll imagine is a rich and powerful university, let's say Hudson University. Servant has read @Friedman1953, and thinks that the only moral obligation of someone in his (for this Servant is surely male) position is to maximise the expected size of the endowment. For simplicity, let's assume that no Newcomb-like problems come up. (There are complications if Servant is thinking of making an investment, and knows his counterpart at Pembroke is making a similar decision, and the payouts each will get are a function of what each will do. We think working this case through leads to a quite different objection to Lewis's argument, and we'll follow Lewis in setting such cases aside as much as possible.)

Lewis (1988) mostly discusses the simple case where all actions are good or bad, all good actions are equally good, and all bad actions are equally bad. That is, as Lewis notes, a drastic simplification. Lewis also notes the fix to it. The final version of the desire as belief thesis he attributes to the anti-Humean is 

(1) V(A) = ∑~v~ vPr(g(A) = v)

That alone, plus some premises Lewis thinks should be uncontroversial, lead to a crisis. There are a few arguments that this implies a crisis; Lewis gives two such arguments in his two papers, and there are others in the secondary literature. The details of these arguments aren't important. What is important is that they are all purely formal. They don't rest on any features specific to g. None of the extra premises are motivated by g being a measure of *goodness*, rather than anything else. So let's take g to measure *profit*. (In any case, Servant thinks profit is goodness, but this isn't strictly necessary for the argument we're making.) And let A be an arbitrary investment decision that Servant could make. 

With those assumptions, Servant's valuation of A will be given by (1). After all, the right hand side of (1) is just the definition of expected utility. And Servant prefers options with higher expected utility to options with lower expected utility. Moreover, how much Servant prefers an option with greater expected utility is a function of how much greater the expected utility is. If Servant makes a calculation blunder and chooses an option with 99% of the expected utility of the best option, he'll feel a bit bad. If he makes a big calculation blunder and chooses an option with 1% of the expected utility of the best option, he'll feel awful. So it isn't that he values the utility maximising option at 1 and everything else at 0; the more expected utility an option returns, the more he wants it. Importantly, this 'want' is entirely downstream of his beliefs. If you fix Servant's beliefs about the investment returns of various options, you fix his values. For Servant, passions are slaves of reason; how much he wants something is a function of how much it grows the endowment.

Servant, as described, seems coherent. He doesn't seem to have trivial, or irrational, beliefs. If Lewis's argument shows that (1) leads to a collision with decision theory, it shows that a simple story about diligent (if slightly narrow-minded) bursars is somehow incoherent. We think that's absurd; it's much more plausible that something has gone wrong with Lewis's argument than that the story about Servant is wrong.

# What is wrong with Lewis's argument

Still, it would be good to say something more about where Lewis's argument actually goes wrong, and how the story of Servant can help clarify that. That's what we'll turn to next. The main conclusion will be that the anti-Humean should never have accepted the DAB thesis Lewis attributes to them. Rather, they should have endorsed all along the Desire-as-Conditional-Belief (DACB) thesis:

(2) V(A) = ∑~v~ vPr(g(A) = v | A)

The first thing to note about Servant's example is that it is a story where the thesis Lewis (1996) calls *Desire By Necessity* is true. Lewis primarily defines Desire by Necessity under the assumption that everything is either good or bad, but it's easy enough to generalise the definition. Let I° be the proposition that things are good. Desire by Necessity says that V(A) = Pr(I° | A). It deserves the name because in the special case where A = I°, A is always desired. To keep with the assumption that things are good or bad, imagine that it is somehow known that the outcome of any investment choice by Servant will be that the endowment ends with a balance of 1 or 0. Let I° be the worlds where it ends with a balance of 1. Then if either (a) there are no Newcomb-like problems around, or (b) Servant uses Evidential Decision Theory to resolve them, it will be true that V(A) = Pr(I° | A). After all, that just means that how much Servant values A is a function of how likely A is to get the value 1.

The only necessity here is that Servant takes it as fixed that it is better that the endowment be larger rather than smaller. There's nothing Servant could learn that would disabuse him of this belief. Maybe you think that's too strong. But remember Servant was meant to be an analogy. The case we're really interested in is where Servant is a servant of the good. It's very strange to think that in that case there is something wrong about being committed to the good, or that one is only 'non-trivial' if one takes it to be an open question whether one prefers the good or the bad.

It is a little unclear what Lewis's objection to Desire by Necessity is. He says it is the "wrong kind of anti-Humean" view. We think he means that it violates the Humean ban on necessary connections between distinct existences, rather than the Humean dictum that reason is the slave of the passions. But while it might violate the ban on necessary connections, what really matters is that it *also* violates the dictum that reason is the slave of the passions. Servant's actions are wholly driven by his beliefs.

Lewis has another argument that DACB can't be the right way to state the anti-Humean view. In the case where everything is good or bad, DACB reduces to V(A) = Pr(A° | A). Lewis's triviality results involving conditional probability show that there is no proposition X such that Pr(X) always equals Pr(A° | A). So on this view, there is no one proposition such that Servant's value for A is a function of his credence in that proposition. But the anti-Humean never needed to sign up for that view. Their view is just that beliefs, collectively, can drive action. And the conditional credence in A° given A, while not identical to any one credence, is determined by Servant's credences collectively.

Lewis also says [near the start of the 1996 paper] that it is important here that V measures desirability, not choice-worthiness. Here is where he might object to our example. For Lewis, a rational Servant will use causal decision theory to make investment decisions, while they will use evidential decision theory to evaluate how much they desire each decision. Now we're not sure this is perfectly consistent with the story Lewis tells about the faculty meeting at the start of the 1988 paper, but set that objection aside. Could it be that our overgeneration argument fails because it doesn't respect this distinction?

If this is a worry for the analogy, we can simply change the case a little. Imagine that Servant has an Underling. Today, Servant is off work sick, so Underling is in charge. Servant thinks that the only good is the increase in expected value of the endowment, so how much Servant desires that Underling make this or that investment is equal to how much it changes the expected endowment. So we still have DACB holding true.

Here it really is DACB that gives the right answer, not DAB. (So we'll at last drop the assumption that there are no Newcomb-like cases around.) Imagine Underling and the bursar at Pembroke are both deciding whether to sell their stock in ACME corporation. They both have some inside information about a disappointing report coming up, so holding on to the stock will lead to a loss of $1 per share. But they are the two biggest holders of ACME, and news of one or other selling will lead to the stock falling $2 per share.

Servant is home sick, and can't do anything. Servant, from his sickbed, is very confident that whatever Underling decides, the bursar at Pembroke will also decide. So while all four of the options below are in play, Servant is very confident that the result will be one of the cells on the main diagonal.

            Pembroke Decision
          Hold         Sell   
    Hold  -$1          -$3
Hudson
    Sell   0           -$2
    
Given everything we've said, Servant hopes that Underling will hold the shares rather than sell them. That will lead to a loss of $1/share, but selling will lead to a loss of $2/share. This is consistent with DACB. It is, however, inconsistent with DAB; no matter what credence Servant has that Pembroke will Hold or Sell, DAB says that Servant hopes that Underling will Sell. After all, whatever Pembroke does, Underling loses $1/share less by selling. That's the wrong outcome in this analogy. So in the analogy, DACB is true, not DAB.

So we think the analogy shows that the anti-Humean argument overgenerates. If V really measures desirability, not choice-worthiness, then the anti-Humean should have endorsed DACB all along. Moreover, the analogy shows how this really is anti-Humean in the right way; it is a case where actions, and desires, are driven entirely by beliefs about how things are.
