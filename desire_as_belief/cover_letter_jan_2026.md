Dear Editors,

I am pleased to resubmit "Anti-Anti-Desire-As-Belief" for publication in Analysis. I am grateful to both referees for their thoughtful and constructive reports.

As recommended by both referees, I have removed the previous sections 3 and 4, which addressed triviality objections to Lewis's argument. The revised paper now focuses exclusively on the Peter case and how it generates independent reasons for rejecting different premises of Lewis's argument depending on one's decision-theoretic commitments.

In response to the specific concerns raised:

**Referee 1** raised several presentational issues, all of which I have addressed: I now use consistent notation throughout (Pr rather than mixing C and Pr), distinguish clearly between conditionalization (subscripts) and imaging (superscripts), and have carefully proofread the manuscript.

Referee 1 also expressed concern about the derivation of Auntie E's value function. I have addressed this by stating the value function directly rather than deriving it, which avoids the technical complications the referee identified while making the dialectical situation clearer.

Regarding Auntie C and the use of imaging, Referee 1 questioned whether causal decision theory genuinely supports the rejection of Additivity. I have strengthened the argument in Section 4 by emphasizing the connection between desire and choiceworthiness through means-end coherence.

**Referee 2** recommended acceptance while noting some remaining philosophical disagreements, particularly about whether imaging is appropriate for an onlooker like Auntie C rather than an agent. I have added a footnote (to what is now line 129) acknowledging this concern and citing recent technical work by Fusco on Dutch Book arguments and imaging, which shows this is a substantive but not fatal complication.

Both referees noted that the core contribution—showing how the Peter case gives defenders of desire-as-belief independent reasons to reject Lewis's premises—is valuable and well-executed. I believe the revised version addresses their concerns while preserving this central insight.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
