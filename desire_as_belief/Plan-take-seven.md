DaB Plan

# Lewis's Argument

Set out the argument, with Max as character who satisfies DaB
Four versions of Max
1. Is moved by beliefs
2. Necessary connection between belief in good and desire
3. Moral connection between belief in good and desire
4. Moral connection between belief in good-making and desire
Four versions of Athena, idealising each of these four
There are passages in Lewis that seem to respond to Athena-1 and Athena-2
But the argument, perhaps ludicrously, tells against all 4
Lots of objections
	Most of them fail - though we'll come back to that in last chapter
	Two of them are successful, more or less
	Aim of this book is to show that the two successful ones are complements

# Moral Uncertaintism

I call it normative internalism - but that's a more general view
Sometimes called moral hedging
	That's a bad name for people who give some credence to extreme views
Better to use Harman's name
Motivations - fairness; symmetry
Problems - regress; fanatics; motivations over-generate; value comparisons
Extra problem - DaB - but we're going to show it isn't a real problem
Assumption - can rationally have non-ideal credences
Moral Uncertaintism seems to imply something like Max is good
So it looks like it walks into DaB

# Newcomb Problem

Do version of a friend who is good on one topic, not on another
Now do the first person version of that
Evidential Moral Uncertaintism - maximise A*/A
Causal Moral Uncertaintism - maximise A*
Which is best? Good forking question.
If evidential, say how Lewis's argument fails
If causal, say how Lewis's argument fails

# Two Forms of Moral Uncertaintism

1. Map out the evidential version, go over strengths and weaknesses
2. Map out the causal version, go over strengths and weaknesses
3. Say what we'd need to say to get an argument against MU, and note that they are really strong assumptions. 

# Rival Objections to Lewis on DaB

Start with noting two views that aren't really rivals
I think I've got a better story motivating them
Then the blog posts
Then start slowly working way through literature
