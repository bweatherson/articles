# A Puzzle Case, and an Objection

Set out the case
Note the two ways of making it work
Note that either way, there is a step in Lewis's argument that isn't right

# Developing the Evidential Theory

Simple model with pairs of facts and values
Prove that it is relatively consistent
Note that this is a two-edged sword; maybe these aren't really credences.
Problem for conditionalisation
Maybe that's not the end of the world, but it's a bit funny
Complex model with pairs of facts and total evaluation
Note that it is complex, and weird (but expressive!)
Note that it is anti-functionalist, in the context of the evidential theory

# Developing the Causal Theory

Set out the division into Acts, Hypotheses and States
Three possible non-evidential approaches
Natural to say that H does not divide (d,m) from (d1,m)
But still don't get U(A) = Pr(A*), since A might make different facts more likely, and those facts might affect goodness.
So I'm not sure who should think U(A) = Pr(A*)
Basically a causalist who thinks that causal effects on facts that constitute goodness can be ruled out structurally.

# Russell and Hawthorne's Example

Set out from NE 10.6
Say why it is really about probability
But still an interesting and hard question
But then whatâ€¦
