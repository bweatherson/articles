# Plan for Section 4

DACB as response
CDT as response
Putting them together
Contextualist response
Rejecting Invariantism
Part 1 - V(T) = c; I get the intuition, but it really doesn't work on the formalism
D(A) as either V(A) - V(T), or as V(A) - V(~A), won't satisfy desire as belief
Isn't what we should want given the Meane and Neiss example
What does V mean? Not news-worthiness, but news-contentedness. And that's the only thing we could want it to mean given DAB or DACB
Part 2 - Requires that anything can be halo'd. This isn't right either
We can see this by looking at a model for DACB that works

# Plan for Section 5

What does end of DAB2 mean?
Two kinds of anti-Humean view: metaphysics and psychology
First kind isn't relevant, as Bradley2016 says; it's a normative theory
Really, every besire theory is normative; they all have "except for irrationality" clauses
But the second kind is interesting, and worth looking at
Start with a model where credences are defined over concreta, and values are too, and values are 0-1
Then extend this to a model where credences are defined over concreta-value pairs, and values don't play any role. (Note that this is drawing on Bradley-List)
We can always do this! But this can't be enough to save anti-Humeanism. This is like the cheap anti-Humeanism of section 7.
We can do more - assume that values are bounded above and below (to avoid St Pete problems)
Then rescale to 0 and 1, and set Cr(<A, 1>) to be Cr(A) * V(A), while Cr(<A, 0>) = Cr(A) * (1 - V(A)).
Let G be the set of all <c, v> s.t. v = 1
Then let Å be any proposition that entails A > G (horseshoe), and is entailed by A & G.
This will satisfy DACB. And it will satisfy invariance. V(<c, 1>) = 1, and V(<c, 0>) = 0, no matter what we learn.
But there is no way to interpret Å such that it satisfies DAB, at least given this interpretation of V.
So that proves (a) the argument for Invariance doesn't rest on dubiously double-halo-ing propositions, and (b) DACB is consistent as long as evidential decision theory with bounded value functions is consistent.

# Two Ways of Adding Values to Worlds

Option 1: worlds are concreta-value pairs
Upside: Get DACB, seem to get what uncertaintists want
Downside: Updating by conditionalisation fails. Simple example of A is a coin-flip, Å is initially 50/50 and independent, but then we learn Å. This can't be by conditionalising on anything really.
Response: Image instead (following Collins)
Problem: This blows up strong uncertantism, since we really aren't treating factual and normative uncertainty the same way. And more generally, it is a reason to think this formalism isn't a way of modelling beliefs at all.
Response 1: Some other beliefs have to be updated this way (following Oddie, Meacham) - but do we really want to be committed to moral attitudes being like self-locating beliefs. That would be a big constraint. (This is more of a worry for the uncertaintist than the anti-Humean more generally)
Response 2: worlds are concreta-value function pairs, so <c, V>, not <c, vO
Objection: What difference do the 'off-line' values of the function make?
	Maybe they are like off equilibrium points in a game table?
Objection: Why would we even have 'mix-and-match'?
    Maybe a weird kind of rigidified relativism?
Objection: This lets us state weird views, like necessary Panglossianism
    It's a good thing that we can state weird views; nothing wrong with a formalism that lets us do this
    Compare, nothing wrong with English that it lets us state these views
So let's go with <c, V> worlds, and updating by conditionalisation
V(<c, V>) = V(c). This is a stupid formulation; I must do better
But this seems better; at least allows conditionalisation, and lets us say what A is good comes to.
