# Overview

* Why this all matters
* Lewis's second argument
* A Newcomb-like case for moral uncertaintists
* Three interpretations of V; and why Lewis's argument fails on all of them
* Defending Invariance
* Modelling DAB
* What makes something a belief, not a desire

# Things I Will Happily Discuss, But Don't Have on Today's Schedule

1. Russell and Hawthorne's argument from structural facts about updating. (Short version - I've come around to thinking the puzzles here are mostly on the probability side; it's folks who think we should use beliefs about probabilities where probabilities are called for who are threatened by their argument.)
2. Ittay's argument from chance. (Short version - I think I can live with independence of goodness and truth in cases where chances are well defined.)

# Why This Matters

* Moral uncertaintists say that good action (of a certain kind) is sensitive solely to doxastic states.
* In particular, they say that beliefs about the goodness of certain acts/outcomes is sufficient to determine which act should be taken.
* Lewis's argument _looks_ like it is an argument against anyone who tries to have beliefs and beliefs only (i.e., not desires) suffice for action.

# Lewis's Second Argument

* I'm not going to go over the 1988 argument, which relies on some really controversial assumptions. Instead I'll go over the 1996 argument. There are some interpolations here, but I think I've got the basic structure.
* Assume that we have a finite set of _worlds_. We will use _w_ as a variable over worlds. A world, in this sense, is a specification of the truth value of all the truth-apt things that are relevant to a particular decision.
* They are more coarse grained than Lewisian concreta in that they only specify relevant truth values, not all truth values. That's why we can assume that there are finitely many of them.
* But they are more fine grained than Lewisian concreta in that we'll allow for moral uncertainty, even though metaphysically there cannot be worlds that differ morally without differing factually.

## Terminology

* $A$ is an arbitrary factual proposition; i.e., it is silent on moral questions.
* For any such factual proposition, we can construct a distinct proposition $A°$, meaning that $A$ is good.
* $V$ is the agent's value function, $\Pr$ is their credence function, and subscripts represent what those functions are like after updating. So $V_A$ and $\Pr_A$ are the value and credence functions after updating on $A$. Strictly speaking, it is sets of worlds that get values, but I'll often write $V(w)$ for $V({w})$.
* Lewis's target is the equation $V(A) = \Pr(A°)$

## Assumptions

Invariance
:    $V_A(w) = V(w)$

Additivity
:    $V(A) = \sum_w V(w)\Pr(w | A)$

Restricted Conditionalisation (Restricted because it only applies to updating on factual propositions)
:    $\Pr_A(B) = \Pr(B | A)$

Good-Bad (To be dropped soon - but very convenient)
:    All worlds are either GOOD or BAD. If $w$ is GOOD, then $V(w) = 1$, and otherwise $V(w) = 0$

## The Argument

``
\begin{align*}
\Pr(A°) &= V(A) \\
        &= \sum_w V(w) \Pr(w | A) && \text{(Additivity)} \\
        &= \sum_w V_A(w) \Pr(w | A) && \text{(Invariance)} \\
        &= \sum_w V_A(w) \Pr_A(w | A) && \text{(Restricted Conditionalisation)} \\
        &= V_A(A) && \text{(Additivity), applied to updated values} \\
        &= \Pr_A(A°) \\
        &= \Pr(A° | A) && \text{(Restricted Conditionalisation)} 
\end{align*}
``{=latex}

But it is absurd that $A°$ and $A$ are independent. At least, it's absurd if evaluative uncertainty is coherent. The following situation seems perfectly coherent. H, a hero, is facing a tricky moral dilemma. They have to choose between respecting rights and maximising welfare. Let $A$ be the proposition that they respect rights in this situation, and $A°$ be that it is good for them to do so. It is coherent to not know what H will do, and not know what it would be good for them to do, but think that if they do $A$, that will be evidence for $A°$. It may not be conclusive evidence, even heroes make mistakes, but it is coherent to think that it is some evidence. Lewisian Desire-As-Belief implies it is no evidence at all, and this is absurd.

* Lewis doesn't in fact stop at this point, but offers another argument about how absurd this would be after updating on $A \vee A°$. I don't think that argument is very good, and we can go over why if you like.
