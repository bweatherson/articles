Morrigan, our protagonist, faces a difficult moral decision. Unfortunately, she doesn't know which decision is morally right. And she wants to do what's morally right. Fortunately, her mentor Jupiter is very good at these kinds of decisions, and he faces the exact same kind of decision. In this case it seems easy to say what Morrigan should do. She should do whatever Jupiter does.

Here's a philosophically harder case. Morrigan faces a difficult moral decision. Unfortunately, she neither knows what is right, nor has a mentor around to use as a role model. Fortunately, she is, as she knows, very good at this kind of moral decision. Other people use her as a guide the way she used to use Jupiter, and they are wise to do this. So perhaps she should use herself as a guide. Perhaps, that is, she should just act instinctively, and then feel happy with whatever she does. After all, her doing it is evidence that it is good, since a good person did it. This reasoning feels less convincing to me than the previous paragraph, but not utterly absurd. This paper is
