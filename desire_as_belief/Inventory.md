# Book-notes.md

An intro
Has the formal argument and why Ittay's version is better than Lewis's

# Md-notes.md

Has a statement of the two Humean theses that might be at play
Has quick statement of the conditionalisation problem
Also notes that the anti-conditionalisation move loses symmetry

# Imaging-Everywhere.md

Start of reason why I don't like imaging everywhere (very short)

# Take-three.md

Not much here
Some exegetical thoughts that don't go far
And start of the two models of evidentialist theory

# Take-two.md

Starts with uncertaintism and a bit of background to it
Then a version of the formal argument, though using the update on A v G(A) premise
Then goes through the puzzle but focussing on V-interpretation
I now think this is superseded; better to focus on the Newcomb problem
3600 words here, but not much usable

# Take-four.md

Again uses moral uncertaintism as framing device (I now want to use that as one motivation among many)
Then technical argument, again not as clean as I now like
Then the same subsequent things as in take-two, and again I don't really like it

# Defending-Invariance.md

Just a header!

# Take-five

Just a plan
Note that the functionalism/conditionalisation problems are within evidential theory
Some sketchy notes on problems for 'causal'/constitutive model

# Evidentialist Chapter

Feels like useful start to actual evidentialist chapter
Starts with the relative consistency proof
Doesn't actually finish relative consistency proof, but useful starting point
