In recent years many philosophers have argued that our actions should be sensitive to not just what is actually morally right and wrong, but to what is probably morally right and wrong. On these theorists' views, moral uncertainty should matter to decision making in a similar way to how factual uncertainty matters. Some of these theorists would say the previous statement is too weak; moral uncertainty and factual uncertainty should impact decision making in exactly the same way. Following a suggestion by Elizabeth [#Harman201x;], I'll call such a view _uncertaintism_, and their proponents _uncertaintists_.

One structural feature of uncertaintism is that it makes a certain kind of decision making insensitive to desires. Given the beliefs of the decider, including their moral beliefs, we can say what is best to do by that decider's own lights. In a pair of papers, David [#Lewis1988x, Lewis1996x;] argued against the viability of any such theory. Such theories violate his version of Hume's dictum that reason should be the slave of the passions, and he argued that they are incompatible with our best theories of how belief states should be updated. In a recent paper Jeffrey Russell and John Hawthorne `\citeyearpar{RussellHawthorne2016}`{=latex} show that Lewis's arguments do not turn on the precise details of the update rules he presupposed, but only on some very weak structural features of those rules. Prima facie, it looks like Russell and Hawthorne's arguments show that uncertaintism is incoherent.

I'm going to argue (contra Lewis, but with Russell and Hawthorne) that this is ultimately a challenge for uncertaintism, but not a decisive objection to it. There is a somewhat plausible way to pair uncertaintism with a theory of what belief states are and how they are updated. The resulting theory is somewhat weird, and rather complicated. It requires borrowing some tools from the theory of probabilistic knowledge recently developed by Sarah [#Moss2018;], and other tools from the response Jessica [#Collins201x;] offers to Lewis's argument. And it is, I'll argue, incompatible with the strong form of uncertaintism that treats factual and moral uncertainty exactly the same way. So I'm going to argue that there is a challenge for uncertaintism that is interesting, and we learn a lot by seeing how to possibly resolve it. Indeed it will be interesting to see what other responses there are, because I'm not going to argue that my solution is only possible response. But there is not ultimately a new objection to uncertaintism on offer. 


# The Puzzle

David Lewis's Desire as Belief papers are difficult [#Lewis1988x, Lewis1996x]. That's not because the math is particularly complicated. The math is more complicated than it needs to be; the formal argument is really quite simple. But even still, it isn't that complicated to follow Lewis's formalism. No, what's difficult about the paper is identifying exactly which theories Lewis is attacking, and why he is attacking them. A recent volume of papers on Lewis [#LoewerSchafer201x] features papers by [#Hajek201x;] and by [#Collins201x;] that discuss the Desire as Belief argument, and both express puzzlement about what Lewis is up to at various points. I don't plan to resolve this puzzlement, but I will say a bit about what is puzzling.

The Desire as Belief papers lie at the intersection of two broader projects Lewis pursued. Confusingly, both of these projects he referred to as 'Humean', because they were motivated by famous lines from David Hume. (But don't expect that Lewis, or I, will do much to place these views within Hume's broader outlook. We're borrowing lines here, not whole theories.) To keep the two projects distinct, I'll call them **Humean metaphysics** and **Humean psychology**.

Humean Metaphysics
:    There are no necessary connections between distinct existences.

Humean Psychology
:    Reason is the slave of the passions.

Lewis believes the first, with just one caveat. There can be merely verbal necessary connections between distinct existences. Perhaps I only count as believing that Lewis is a great philosopher if Lewis exists. And I do believe that Lewis is a great philosopher. So there seems to be some kind of necessary connection between my thought and Lewis's existence. Does this violate Humean metaphysics? No; because Lewis believed in narrow content. If Lewis didn't exist, but I was unchanged, my fundamental nature would be the same. It just would be wrong to describe someone with that nature as believing that _Lewis_ was a great philosopher. 

The second is a little more complicated. Lewis clearly wants to reject a view where the passions, i.e., desires or whatever plays the desire-role in getting to belief, is the slave of the beliefs. But I don't really see how he makes reason the slave of the passions. It's better to say that on his view, reasons (i.e., beliefs) and passions (i.e., desires) are co-equal branches of our inner government. Action, or at least action that makes sense from the inside, is the product of both.

Lewis thinks theories that have belief about the good play the role traditionally allocated to desire, such as theories which say that rational agents act so as to maximise expected goodness, are not Humean. But, and this is one source of puzzlement, it isn't always clear which of the Humean theories they violate. Are such theories assuming a necessary connection between distinct psychological existences, e.g., by assuming that necessarily one has a desire iff one has corresponding beliefs about the good? It is hard to see how they are. After all, as [#BradleyEtc2016;] point out, a lot of theorists have a normative claim here, not a descriptive claim. They don't say that beliefs about the good necessarily play the role of desires, only that it is good for agents to have desires that track their beliefs about the good. And such a normative theory could not possibly violate Humean metaphysics. 

Even if we took desire as belief theory to express a necessary connection between belief and desire, it still isn't clear why it would violate Humean metaphysics. Humean metaphysics only rules out necessary connections between distinct existences, and it is a tricky question whether beliefs and desires are genuinely distinct in the relevant sense. On one approach to the metaphysics of mind, the primitive states are preferences over gambles, and both beliefs and desires are constructed out of these preferences. This metaphysics is controversial, but a theorist who accepted it could accept a necessary connection between belief and desire without violating the letter of Humean metaphysics.

But this is not enough to conclude that the Desire as Belief thesis "is not anti-Humean" [693][#BradleyStefaÙè∞Änsson2016]. It might still violate what I'm calling Humean psychology. After all, it really does look like a thesis where what one desires is governed by what one believes about the good.

# A Solution

Neither of the previous two options on their own seemed to work. But we can get a solution that does work by mixing the two of them. First, note that if we want to use the idea that worlds are concreta-value pairs, then we have a good reason to give up on conditionalisation in general.

Assume Summer is interested in just two (factual) propositions, $A$ and $B$. (That is, these are all that matter for the decision she's currently contemplating.) There are four combinations of truth values for these two propositions. But for each of these four combinations, there is the further question about whether this outcome would be good or not. So there are eight pairs $\langle c, v \rangle$ that Summer is interested in. For simplicity (although this is very implausible in practice) assume that each of these eight are equiprobable for Summer, i.e., she has credence $\nicefrac{1}{8}$ in each.

Now Summer learns something. She hears a good philosophical argument to the conclusion that it would be bad if $A$ and $B$ were both true. She is convinced, correctly, that she can rule out the pair $\langle A \wedge B, 1\rangle$. But how should she redistribute her credences over the seven possibilities that are still open to her? 

If she updates by conditionalisation, then after learning that it would be bad if $A \wedge B$ were true, she should have credence $\nicefrac{1}{7}$ in each of these seven pairs. This seems like a result that's too good to be true. Just learning that $A \wedge B$ is bad is enough reason to lower her credence in it from $\nicefrac{1}{4}$ to $\nicefrac{1}{7}$. Of course, if she'd learned that $A \wedge B$ was actually good, that would also lower her credence in it to $\nicefrac{1}{7}$, though now it would seem unreasonably pessimistic.

In general, on this model, resolving uncertainty about the moral status of a factual claim will, ceteris paribus, lower the probability of that factual claim. But that's rather implausible, at least as a fully general principle. It is possible that Summer's credence in $A \wedge B$ was $\nicefrac{1}{4}$ because she knew the objective chance of $A \wedge B$ was $\nicefrac{1}{4}$. Learning something about the value (or disvalue) of $A \wedge B$ isn't the kind of reason for her to have a different credence than its known chance. So we can't simultaneously hold on to the idea that the contents of beliefs are concreta-value pairs, and to the idea that belief updating always goes by conditionalisation. 

But we can solve this problem by mixing conditionalisation with imaging. (The method I'm about the describe bears a striking resemblance to the proposal offered by [#Meacham2008;] for updating de se beliefs.) Say a proposition, i.e., a set of concreta-value pairs, is _purely factual_ if whenever $\langle c, v \rangle$ is in the set, so is $\langle c, 1-v \rangle$. (If there are more than two values, the rule is that membership is closed under variation in second element of pairs.) Here is now the rule for how to update a credence function $Cr$ on evidence $E$.

1. Conditionalise on the strongest purely factual proposition entailed by $E$.
2. Image on $E$.
3. In step 2, the closest world to $\langle c, v \rangle$ is $\langle c, 1-v \rangle$, so this step never changes credences over purely factual propositions.[^There are a few options for how to generalise this to the case where there are more than two values, but the precise option one takes isn't important for current purposes.]

This strategy has a lot of benefits; I'll just list three of them.

First, it preserves conditionalisation as the update rule for updating on purely factual propositions. So any theory in epistemology or philosophy of science that assumes updates go by conditionalisation will still work, as long as that theory is restricted to purely factual propositions. But in practice, most such theories are (at least implicitly) so restricted; they are not making distinctions on the basis of the moral value of concreta.

Second, it gets the intuitively correct answer in Summer's case. If we apply this method, then $Cr(\langle A \wedge B, 0 \rangle)$ is $\nicefrac{1}{4}$, and the other six open possibilities have credence $\nicefrac{1}{8}.

Third, it lets us avoid the Russell-Hawthorne argument. That argument, by design, only applied to theories that had commutative update rules. And this update rule is not commutative. Indeed, the rule is not even monotonic. Imagine that Summer changes her mind, and after ruling out $\langle A \wedge B, 1 \rangle$, she decides to rule out $\langle A \wedge B, 0 \rangle$ and nothing else. (That is, she updates on the proposition consisting of the seven possibilities other than $\langle A \wedge B, 0 \rangle$.) Now she'll have credence $\nicefrac{1}{4}$ in $\langle A \wedge B, 1 \rangle$. And she'll have this credence even though this very possibility was ruled out by the first update. (This is the monotonicity failure.) But if she'd done things in the reverse order, she have credence 0 in $\langle A \wedge B, 1 \rangle$. (This is the commutativity failure.)

Now I don't want to suggest that there are no problems with this approach. For one thing, it requires us to be careful at points that other theories do not have to be careful. Consider again what Summer is like after updating on the set consisting of all seven possibilities except $\langle A \wedge B, 1 \rangle$. If we just focus on the 'universe' consisting of the seven possibilities she treats as open, the following two propositions are true at exactly the same points.

* $\neg(A \wedge B)$, i.e., the set of six possibilities that excludes $\langle A \wedge B, 1 \rangle$ and $\langle A \wedge B, 0 \rangle$.
* It is not the case that $A \wedge B$ is both true and good, i.e., the set of seven possibilities that excludes $\langle A \wedge B, 0 \rangle$.

But as we just saw, updating on these propositions produces different outcomes. So when determining the content of an update, we may have to attend to how those updates classify possibilities that are (pre-update) ruled out. This feels odd, but perhaps it is a price worth paying if we think the theory is otherwise plausible.

And if the theory is plausible, then the objection to uncertaintism doesn't go through. We have a theory, the Gibbardian version of desire-by-necessity supplemented with this non-standard update rule, that captures much of what uncertaintists wanted, and is immune to the objections from both Lewis and from Russell and Hawthorne.

# Open Questions

That said, there are many questions that I have left open. I would like to say that's for space reasons, but that would be a lie; I don't know the answers to several of these questions and hope to explore them in future research.

* Is the approach outlined here acceptable as a way to save Weak Uncertaintism from Lewisian objections?

I think the answer is **yes**, but obviously I am far from having a proof of that. What I've shown is that a particular theory avoids a particular way of spelling out the objection. Whether the theory will turn out to be subject to its own counterexamples is something that we'll be better able to tell after other philosophers have a go at counterexampling it.

* Is the approach outlined here acceptable as a way to save Strong Uncertaintism from Lewisian objections?

I think the answer is **no**, and more generally, I think we have reason to suspect that Strong Uncertaintism really is vulnerable to these objections. 

* Is this acceptable as a way to save Weak Uncertaintism (Yes)
* Is this acceptable as a way to save Strong Uncertaintism (No, and I suspect nothing is)
* Are there other solutions (maybe - the obvious objection to RH fails)
* Is this Humean? Well  - yes on metaphysics, maybe no on motivation
* Are these even beliefs? Relatedly, is this the truth-conditional solution that RH speculate doesn't obtain? Arg for no - very odd updates; haven't we just renamed desires. Arg for yes - in the model we can mix and match, e.g., create cross-cutting disjunctions. Interesting question for further research.
