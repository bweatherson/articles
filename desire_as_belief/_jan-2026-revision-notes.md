# Point 1 - What is D?

Suggested clarification to add:
Something like:

"D represents 'things are desirable' - more precisely, 'things are good with respect to the choice at hand.' Since we're holding all background facts fixed and evaluating only Peter's choice between A and ¬A, we have D ↔ Å: things turn out well if and only if Peter does what is in fact desirable. The value functions given for each Auntie are not meant to be complete value functions over all propositions, but rather the fragment relevant to evaluating Peter's specific choice."

This also helps with the reviewer's related confusion: "And how could D be a truth-function just of A and Å?" Your answer: it IS just a truth-function of A and Å precisely because we're restricting to this single choice problem.
This is clean, defensible, and actually quite standard in decision theory contexts where you restrict attention to a particular decision problem.
