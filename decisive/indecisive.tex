\section{Decisiveness}\label{decisiveness}}

Say a decision theory is \textbf{decisive} iff for any decision problem,
it says either:

Picture is ``Study for `The Bear Hunt' (for the Alcázar, Madrid)'' by
Peter Paul Rubens via
\href{https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1983.69}{Cleveland Museum of
Art}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There is a uniquely best choice, and rationality requires choosing
  it.; or
\item
  There is a non-singleton set of choices each of which is tied for
  being best, and each of which can be permissibly chosen.
\end{enumerate}

A decision theory is \textbf{decisive over binary choices} iff it
satisfies this condition for all decision problems where there are just
two choices. Most decision theories in the literature are decisive, and
of those that are not, most of them are at least decisive over binary
choices. I'm going to argue that the correct decision theory, whatever
it is, is indecisive. It is not, I'll argue, even decisive over binary
choices.

The argument is going to be broadly abductive. I'm going to look at a
lot of existing decision theories, and argue that each of them fails.
Indeed, I'm going to argue that each of them can be refuted by the very
same argument. I'll suggest that the source of the problem is what those
theories have in common, namely their decisiveness. To be clear, that
last suggestion is going to be little more than a suggestion. I think
you'll find it pretty plausible once you see the range of theories that
fail, and how easy it is to generate problem cases for new kinds of
decisive theories. But it's certainly possible that one consequence of
this paper is that someone will devise a new decisive decision theory
that avoids the problem. That would be a pleasing kind of progress.

The argument I referred to in the last paragraph turns on a pair of very
similar decision problems. Each problem has the following structure.
There is a human Player, and a predictor, who I'll call Doctor. Doctor
is very good, as good as the demon in Newcomb's problem, at predicting
Player's behavior. Doctor will make two decisions. First, they will
opt-in (which I'll write as I for In), or opt-out (which I'll write as O
for out). If they opt-out, Doctor gets \$1, and Player gets \$100.
(Assume both Doctor and Player prefer more money to less, and indeed
that over these small sums there is more or less no declining marginal
utility of money.) If they opt-in, this will be publicly announced, an
another game will be played. Each of Doctor and Player will
(independently) pick a letter: A or B. Doctor will aim to predict
Player's choice, and will be rewarded iff that prediction is correct.
Here is the payout table for the possible outcomes of this game.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}cccc@{}}
\toprule
Human Pick & Doctor Pick & Human Reward & Doctor Reward \\
\midrule
\endhead
A & A & \$6 & \$4 \\
A & B & \$0 & \$0 \\
B & A & \$3 & \$0 \\
B & B & \$4 & \$1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

If you prefer this in the way we standardly present games in normal
form, it looks like this, with the human as Row, doctor as Column, and
in each cell the human's payout is listed first. (All payouts are in
dollars)

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}r|cc}

\textbf{ } & \textbf{A} & \textbf{B}\\
\midrule
\textbf{A} & 6,4 & 0,0\\
\textbf{B} & 3,0 & 4,1\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Doctor is good at predictions, and prefers more money to less. So if
Doctor predicts Player will choose A, they will opt-in, and also play A,
getting \$4. But what if they predict Player will choose B. They will
get \$1 either by opting-out, or by opting-in and choosing B. Since they
are indifferent in this case, let's say they will flip a coin to decide
which way to go. And Player knows that this is how Doctor will decide,
should Doctor predict Player will choose B. Doctor will also flip a coin
to decide what prediction to make if they think Player is completely
indifferent between the choices, and Player also knows this.

Now I said there were going to be two problems. Here's how they are
created. two Players, Amsterdam and Brussels, will play the game. They
have identical utility functions over money, and identical prior
probability distributions about what Doctor will do conditional on each
of their choices. That's to say, they both think the probability that
Doctor will be wrong is vanishingly small. But Brussels is busy and has
to run to the bank, so they have to write their decision in an envelope
that will be revealed, after Doctor chooses A or B, iff Doctor opts-in
in the game with Brussels. Amsterdam, on the other hand, gets to see
Doctor's decision about whether to opt-in or opt-out, and then (if
Doctor opts-in) has to write their decision in an envelope that will be
revealed after Doctor chooses A or B. For ease of reference, call
Brussels's decision the \emph{early} decision and Amsterdam's decision
the \emph{late} decision.

Here is the core philosophical premise in the argument to follow.

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[The Core Premise]
If there is is precisely one permissible choice for Amsterdam, and one
permissible choice for Brussels, then it must be the same choice. That
is, if each of them is obliged to choose a particular letter, it must be
the same letter. It can't be that one is obliged to choose A, and the
other obliged to choose B.
\end{description}

I'm calling \textbf{The Core Premise} a premise, though in the next
section I'll offer a few arguments for it, in case you don't think it is
obviously correct. (I sort of think it is obviously correct, but I'm
really not going to rely on you sharing that intuition.) And it turns
out that a huge number of theories violate this. Some of them say taht
Amsterdam should choose A and Brussels should choose B, but a few say
the reverse. Either way, I think the pair of recommendations each theory
offers is incoherent, so those decisive theories are mistaken. And I
suspect any other plausible decisive theory will make an incoherent pair
of recommendations in either this case, or one very similar to it. So I
suspect that all decisive theories are mistaken.

\textbf{The Core Premise} is a conditional, but any decisive theory that
denies that the choices are tied will meet the condition. So from now on
in arguing against decisive theories I'll mostly just interpret
\textbf{The Core Premise} as saying Amsterdam and Brussels must make the
same choice. The main thing to check for is that a theory doesn't say
the choices are tied. None of the theories I'll look at will say that,
but it's an important thing to check.

Before we start there are three pieces of important housekeeping.

First, the definition of decisiveness referred to options being tied.
For the definition to be interesting, it can't just be that options are
tied if each is rationally permissible. Then a decisive theory would
just be one that either says one option is mandatory or many options are
permissible. To solve this problem, I'll borrow a technique from Ruth
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chang2002}{Chang}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chang2002}{2002}). Some options are
\textbf{tied} iff either is permissible, but this permissibility is
sensitive to sweetening. That is, if options \(X\) and \(Y\) are tied,
then for any positive \(\varepsilon\), the agent prefers
\(X + \varepsilon\) to \(Y\). If either choice is permissible even if
\(X\) is `sweetened,' i.e.., replaced in the list of choices by
\(X + \varepsilon\), we'll say they aren't tied. My thesis then is that
the correct decision theory says that sometimes there are multiple
permissible options, and each of them would still be permissible if one
of them was sweetened.

Second, there is an important term in the definition of decisiveness
that I haven't clarified: \textbf{decision problem}. Informally, the
argument assumes that in setting out the proble facing Amsterdam and
Brussels is indeed a decision problem. More formally, I'm assuming it
suffices to specify a decision problem to describe the following four
values.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What choices Player has;
\item
  What possible states of the world there are (where it is understood
  that the choices of Player make no causal impact on which state is
  actual)\footnote{My personal preference is to understand states
    historically. For any proposition relevant to the decision, a state
    determines its truth value if it is about the past, or its chance at
    the start of deliberation if it is about the future. And then causal
    independence comes in from a separate presupposition that there is
    no backwards causation. But I definitely won't assume this picture
    of states here.};
\item
  What the probability is of being in any state conditional on making
  each choice; and
\item
  What return Player gets for each choice-state pair.
\end{itemize}

Most recent papers on decision theory do not precisely specify what they
count as a decision problem, but they seem to implicitly share this
assumption, since they will often describe a vignette that settles
nothing beyond these four things as a decision problem. And that's what
I did as well! You should understand this as being part of the
definition of decisiveness. This implies that there are two ways to
reject decisiveness.

First, a theory could say that these four conditions underspecify a real
decision problem. In any real situation, decision theory has a decisive
verdict, but it rests on information, typically information about
Player, not settled by these four values. I'll say a theory that goes
this route is \emph{intrapersonally} decisive, but not
\emph{interpersonally} decisive.

Second, a theory could say that no matter how much one adds to the
specification, there will be cases where the correct decision theory
does not issue a verdict. Such a theory is not \emph{intrapersonally}
decisive. There is nothing you could add about the person to the
specification of a decision problem which decides what they should do,
or even which options are tied. I want to ultimately defend such a view,
and this paper is a part of the defence. But it's a proper part. Nothing
I say here rules out mere interpersonal indecisiveness. That's an
argument for another day. Today, we have enough to be getting on with.

Third, I have set up this problem quite explicitly as a game, with
another player - Doctor. I don't think this is particularly big deal,
though I gather not everyone agrees. In this respect (among others) I'm
following William \protect\hyperlink{ref-Harper1986}{Harper}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Harper1986}{1986}), who recommended treating
Newcomb's Problem as a game. It's not clear why it wouldn't be a game.
The Newcomb demon makes a choice, and if you assume the demon gets
utility 1 from correct predictions and utility 0 from incorrect
predictions, they make the choice that maximises their return given
their beliefs about what the other (human) player will do. So game
theoretic techniques can and should apply. I think any problem with a
predictive demon is best thought of as a game where the demonic player
gets utility 1 or 0 depending on whether their prediction is right. Here
the predictive player, Doctor, has a utility function with slightly more
structure. But if we think decision theory should apply in cases where
there is a predictor around, it should still apply when that predictor
has preferences with slightly more structure.

\hypertarget{defending-the-core-premise}{%
\section{Defending The Core Premise}\label{defending-the-core-premise}}

In this section I'll offer three arguments in defence of \textbf{The
Core Premise}. The first will be to argue that Amsterdam and Brussels
have in a key sense the same choice, the second will argue that
violations of \textbf{The Core Premise} will violate the Sure Thing
Principle, and the third is that violations of \textbf{The Core Premise}
lead to people being willing to pay to avoid information. The arguments
will make frequent use of the following equivalence. A player must
choose a letter iff the player prefers choosing that letter. So I'll
move freely from saying that a theory says Amsterdam should choose X to
saying Amsterdam should prefer X. I don't think this should be
controversial, but it's worth noting. Onto the three arguments.

Think about what Brussels is doing when writing in the envelope. They
know that the envelope will only be opened if Doctor opts-in. If Doctor
does, then what they play will determine their payout. So they should
imagine that Doctor has opted-in, and act accordingly. But in that
imaginative situation, they will do the same thing as if they knew that
Doctor had opted-in. That is, they'll do the same thing Amsterdam will
do. There isn't any difference, for purposes of choice, between
supposing that Doctor has opted-in, and learning that Doctor has
opted-in. And Brussels should suppose that Doctor has opted-in. After
all, they are being asked what to contribute to the game if, and only
if, Doctor opts-in. So the two choices are effectively the same, and
they should get the same verdict. That's the first argument.

Assume that a theory says Amsterdam should do X, but Brussels should do
Y, where X and Y are distinct. Now ask the theory, what should Brussels
prefer conditional on Doctor opting-in, and conditional on Doctor
opting-out. Since Amsterdam should choose X, conditional on Doctor
opting-in, Brussels thinks X is better than Y. And conditional on Doctor
opting-out, Brussels is indifferent between X and Y, so thinks X is as
at least as good as Y. The sure thing principle (or at least the version
that matters here) says that if Brussels knows that precisely one of a
set of outcomes obtains, and X is at least as good as Y conditional on
each member of the set, then X is at least as good as Y overall. But
that contradicts the assumption that Brussels should choose Y. So that's
the second argument.

Assume again that a theory says Amsterdam should do X, but Brussels
should do Y, where X and Y are distinct. Now imagine a third player,
Cardiff. Cardiff isn't busy, like Brussels. But Cardiff hasn't yet found
out whether Doctor has opted-in. They are offered the chance to buy ear
plugs, so they won't hear the announcement of whether Doctor opts-in or
opts-out. They should like to get those, since right now they prefer Y
to X, but there's a chance that they'll hear Doctor has opted-in, which
will leave them in the same situation as Amsterdam, and hence they'll
choose X. And there is nothing they can gain from hearing the
announcement. But this is absurd - a player should not pay to avoid
relevant information about the game. So that's the third argument.

Now this last argument has one caveat. I didn't calculate how much
Player should pay for the ear plugs. That turns out to vary a little
depending on just which decisive theory we are looking at. A theory may
say that Cardiff should not pay anything for the ear plugs, since they
are certain Doctor will opt-out. This third argument isn't particularly
effective, I think, against those theories. But it works well, and I
feel is the strongest argument, against some other theories. But we'll
have to look case by case at just how much a theory would recommend
Cardiff pay for the ear plugs.

So that's the defence of \textbf{The Core Premise}. What I'll now show
is that a wide range of decisive theories violate it, and so we can
conclude they are false.

\hypertarget{early-and-late-choices}{%
\section{Early and Late Choices}\label{early-and-late-choices}}

To see why theories might violate \textbf{The Core Premise}, it's
helpful to set out explicitly the choices that Amsterdam and Brussels
face. And we'll treat Doctor largely as a non-player character, just as
the demon is typically treated in Newcomb's problem. So from now on the
columns will not be Doctor's choices, but what Doctor predicts the human
player chooses. And we'll assume Doctor maximises their financial return
given a correct prediction. It's easy to set out the choice Amsterdam
faces; it's just the embedded game with some notational differences.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}r|cc}

\textbf{ } & \textbf{PA} & \textbf{PB}\\
\midrule
\textbf{A} & 6 & 0\\
\textbf{B} & 3 & 4\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

I've written \textbf{PA} and \textbf{PB} in the columns to indicated
that A or B is Predicted. But in this game that makes little difference,
since Doctor will do whatever they predict Amsterdam will do. Things are
a little different for Brussels. If Doctor predicts that Brussels has
written B, they will flip a coin to decide whether to opt-out, or
opt-in. So we can't write Brussels's return in actual dollars, since we
don't know how the coin lands. But we can write the return in expected
dollars, and we assume that Brussels is after all trying to maximise
expected dollars. (We'll come back to this assumption in the next
section.) So the table Brussels faces looks like this.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}r|cc}

\textbf{ } & \textbf{PA} & \textbf{PB}\\
\midrule
\textbf{A} & 6 & 50\\
\textbf{B} & 3 & 52\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

If Doctor predicts B, then Player has a 1 in 2 chance of getting \$100,
and a 1 in 2 chance of getting the payout from the previous game. So
their average payout is \$50 if they play A, and \$52 if they play B.
Hence the values in the right hand column here.

So what \textbf{The Core Premise} says is that if each of these games
has a uniquely rational choice, it must be the same choice. As we'll
see, a lot of theories do not satisfy this constraint.

\hypertarget{evidential-decision-theory}{%
\section{Evidential Decision Theory}\label{evidential-decision-theory}}

Given a perfect predictor, Evidential Decision Theory says that the only
payout values that matter are those in the main diagonal, running from
northwest to southeast. So Amsterdam should choose A, since they'll
expect to get \$6 from A and \$4 from B. But Brussels should choose B,
since they'll expect to get \$6 from A and \$52 from B. So Evidential
Decision Theory violates \textbf{The Core Premise}, and hence is
mistaken.

When I introduced Cardiff's case, I said we had to check what a
particular theory said about what Cardiff would pay for the earplugs. So
let's do that for Evidential Decision Theory. If Cardiff thinks they
would be told that Doctor has opted-in, they would pay up to \$46 to
avoid that information, since they think they will get \$52 without the
information and \$6 with it. But maybe they would be told that Doctor
opted-out. It turns out the assumption they would be told that is
incoherent, and Cardiff knows it. If they are told Doctor has opted-out,
Doctor will know they are indifferent between the options. And in that
case, Doctor will flip a coin to decide what `prediction' to make. But
if Doctor thinks it is 50/50 what Cardiff will do, they have an expected
return of \$2 from opting-in and choosing A, but an expected return of
\$1 from opting-out. So they will opt-in and choose A, contradicting the
assumption that Cardiff will be told they opted-out. And Cardiff can do
all this reasoning. So Cardiff can predict that if they are told
anything, it will be that Doctor has opted-in, putting them in the same
position as Amsterdam. But if they are told nothing, they are in the
same position as Brussels. And they prefer, by \$46, being in the same
position as Brussels.

Now this is not really a new objection to Evidential Decision Theory.
You can find similar points being made about the strange behaviour of
Evidential Decision Theory in dynamic choice settings as far back as
\protect\hyperlink{ref-GibbardHarper1978}{Gibbard and Harper}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-GibbardHarper1978}{1978}). The details of my
argument are a bit different, but ultimately they rest on the same
foundations. I think those are perfectly solid foundations, but given
how long the arguments have been around, clearly not everyone agrees. So
I want to note one internal tension within Evidential Decision Theory
this case brings up.

As Edward \protect\hyperlink{ref-Elliot2019}{Elliott}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Elliot2019}{2019}) notes, within contemporary
decision theory there is little overlap between work on what to do when
a predictor is around, and work on the nature of risk. All parties to
the former dispute take for granted the orthodox view that when there is
no predictor, one should maximise expected utility. But that's very
controversial within the debates about risk. There the big question is
whether the heterodox risk-weighed utility theory developed by
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quiggin1982}{Quiggin}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Quiggin1982}{1982}) and
\protect\hyperlink{ref-BuchakRisk}{Buchak}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-BuchakRisk}{2013}) is preferable to orthodoxy.

The Quiggin/Buchak view raises a dilemma for Evidential Decision Theory.
If they reject the view and stick with orthodoxy, as most do, they
should have an argument against the risk-weighted view. But the
strongest such arguments turn on the fact that the risk-weighted view
violates the Sure Thing Principle, and leads to people paying to avoid
information. Evidential Decision Theorists can't complain about it on
those grounds, since their theory does the same thing. Alternatively,
they can modify their theory to incorporate the Quiggin/Buchak view. But
then they wouldn't have a decisive decision theory, since on that view
what to do in a decision problem depends on something not typically
specified in the problem, namely the chooser's attitude towards risk. So
even if the Evidential Decision Theorist rejects the arguments behind
\textbf{The Core Premise}, as I suspect most will, they need to either
find a new objection to risk-weighted theories of choice, or modify
their theory in a way that abandons decisiveness. I think the arguments
for \textbf{The Core Premise} are sound, but even if they aren't, it
seems unlikely that there is a plausible \emph{decisive} theory that can
be derived from Evidential Decision Theory.

\hypertarget{stag-hunt}{%
\section{Stag Hunt}\label{stag-hunt}}

It's possible to transform any decision problem involving a predictor
into a game. David \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lewis1979e}{Lewis}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lewis1979e}{1979}) already noted the
relationship between Prisoners' Dilemma and Newcomb's Problem. And
William \protect\hyperlink{ref-Harper1986}{Harper}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Harper1986}{1986}) noted that you could turn any
problem involving a predictor into a game by assuming the predictor
wants to make correct predictions and acts in their own interest.

It's also frequently possible to do the reverse transformation, to turn
a game into a decision problem involving a predictor. Start with any
one-shot two person game, where each player has the same number of
choices in front of them. Then change the payout for Column so that they
get 1 if Row and Column make the `same' choice (for some mapping between
Row's and Column's choices), and 0 otherwise. Then just treat the Column
player as a known to be accurate predictor, either an agent making
predictive choices or a state of the world that tracks the agent's
choices in some way. Now Row's choice is just a familiar kind of
decision problem.

If you plug various famous games into the recipe from the previous
paragraph, you get some familiar examples from modern decision theory.
If you start with Prisoners' Dilemma and apply this recipe, you get
Newcomb's Problem. If you start with Matching Pennies\footnote{You can
  see examples of all these games, and all the game theoretic machinery
  I use throughout this paper, in any standard game theory textbook. My
  favorite such textbook is \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bonanno2018}{Bonanno}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bonanno2018}{2018}), which has the two
  advantages of being philosophically sophisticated and open access. I'm
  not going to include citations for every bit of textbook game theory I
  use; that seems about as appropriate as citing an undergrad logic
  textbook every time I use logic. But if you want more details on
  anything unfamiliar in this paper, that's where to look.} , you get
Death in Damascus (\protect\hyperlink{ref-GibbardHarper1978}{Gibbard and
Harper 1978}). If you start with Battle of the Sexes, you get Asymmetric
Death in Damascus (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Richter1984}{Richter 1984}).
If you start with Chicken, you get the Psychopath Button
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Egan2007-EGASCT}{Egan 2007}). But there hasn't
been quite as much attention paid to what happens if you start with Stag
Hunt and run this recipe. The game you get turns out to be very useful
for classifying decisive decision theories that choose two boxes in
Newcomb's Problem.

Here is an abstract form of a Stag Hunt game, where the options are G/g
for Gather or H/h for Hunt. Actually, this is a table for a generic
symmetric game; what makes it a Stag Hunt are the four constraints
listed below.\footnote{I've listed the constraints as strict
  inequalities, but that might be over the top. Sometimes you'll see one
  or other of these constraints weakened to an inclusive inequality.
  This difference won't matter for current purposes.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}r|cc}

\textbf{ } & \textbf{g} & \textbf{h}\\
\midrule
\textbf{G} & $x, x$ & $y, z$\\
\textbf{H} & $z, y$ & $w, w$\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(x > z\)
\item
  \(w > y\)
\item
  \(w > x\)
\item
  \(\frac{x + y}{2} > \frac{z + w}{2}\)
\end{itemize}

The first two constraints imply that \(\langle G, g \rangle\) and
\(\langle H, h \rangle\) are both equilibria. This isn't like Prisoners'
Dilemma, that only has one equilibrium. But it is like Prisoners'
Dilemma in that there is a cooperative solution, in this case
\(\langle H, h \rangle\), but it isn't always easy to get to it. It
isn't easy because there are at least two kinds of reasons to play
\(G\).

First, one might play \(G\) because one wants to minimise regret. Each
play is a guess that the other player will do the same thing. If one
plays \(G\) and guesses wrong, one loses \(w - y\) compared to what one
could have received. If one plays \(H\) and guesses wrong, one loses
\(x - z\). And the last constraint entails that \(x - z > w - y\). So
playing \(G\) minimises possible regret.

Second, one might want to maximise expected utility, given uncertainty
about what the other player will do. Since one has no reason to think
the other player will prefer \(g\) to \(h\) or vice versa - both are
equilibria - maybe one should give each of them equal probability. And
then it will turn out that \(G\) is the option with highest expected
utility. Intuitively, \(H\) is a risky option and \(G\) is a safe
option, and when in doubt, perhaps one should go for the safe option.

What I'll call a \emph{Stag Decision} is basically a Stag Hunt game
where the other player is a predictor. So the decision looks like this,
where the above four constraints on the values still hold, and
\textbf{PX} means the predictor predicts \textbf{X} will be chosen.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}r|cc}

\textbf{ } & \textbf{PG} & \textbf{PH}\\
\midrule
\textbf{G} & $x$ & $y$\\
\textbf{H} & $z$ & $w$\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These kinds of decisions are important in the history of game theory
because they illustrate in the one game the two most prominent theories
of equilibrium selection: risk dominance and payoff dominance
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-HarsanyiSelten1988}{Harsanyi and Selten 1988}).
Risk dominance recommends gathering; payoff dominance recommends
hunting. And most contemporary proponents of decisive decision theories
in philosophy fall into one of these two camps.

In principle, there are three different views that a decisive theory
could have about Stag Decisions: always Hunt, always Gather, or
sometimes do one and sometimes the other. A decisive theory has to give
a particular recommendation on any given Stag Decision, but it could say
that the four constraints don't settle what that decision should be.
Still, in practice all existing decisive theories fall into one or other
of the first two categories.

One approach, endorsed for rather different reasons by Richard
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jeffrey1983}{Jeffrey}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jeffrey1983}{1983}) and Frank
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Arntzenius2008}{Arntzenius}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Arntzenius2008}{2008}), says to hunt because it
says in decisions with multiple equilibria, one should choose the
equilibria with the best payout. This approach will end up agreeing with
everything the Evidential Decision Theorist says about the choices
facing Amsterdam and Brussels, and should be rejected for the same
reason. It treats differently choices that are fundamentally the same,
it violates Sure Thing, and it says Cardiff should pay \$46 to avoid
finding out what Doctor selected. And the same will be true for any
decisive theory that says to always Hunt in Stag Decisions.

Another family of approaches says to always Gather in Stag Decisions.
For very different reasons, this kind of view is endorsed by Ralph
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wedgwood2013}{Wedgwood}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wedgwood2013}{2013}), Dmitri
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gallow2020}{Gallow}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gallow2020}{2020}) and Abelard
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Podgorski2022}{Podgorski}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Podgorski2022}{forthcoming}). These three views
differ from each other in how they motivate Gathering, and in how they
extend the view to other choices, but they all agree that one should
Gather in any Stag Decision. And this leads to the reverse problem to
that facing the always Hunt view.

Both Amsterdam and Brussels are facing Stag Decisions. But for
Amsterdam, choosing A is Hunting and choosing B is Gathering, while for
Brussels, choosing A is Gathering and choosing B is Hunting. So any view
which says to always Gather will say that Amsterdam should choose B, and
Brussels should choose A. Again, this treats differently choices that
are fundamentally the same, and violates Sure Thing. But does it mean
Cardiff will pay to avoid information? Here things are a little
trickier, because Cardiff has four possible choices: Receive information
or pay to decline it, and then choose A or B. And the different
approaches to Gathering say different things about how to make decisions
in four-way choices. So let's set that argument for \textbf{The Core
Premise} aside - the first two arguments for it still seem like decisive
objections to any view that one should always Gather.

What about views that deny that all Stag Decisions should be treated
alike? As I've said, I don't think any such view is in the literature,
but it's good to think about other views. Let's drop the assumption that
we're even looking at a Stag Decision (though it will turn out that we
are), and think about what to in general in cases where there are two
strict equilibria. That is, think about what our imaginary decisive
decision theory will say about the following case, where we just have
the constraints \(x > z\) and \(w > y\), and again \(PX\) means the
predictor predicts \(X\).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}r|cc}

\textbf{ } & \textbf{PE} & \textbf{PF}\\
\midrule
\textbf{E} & $x$ & $y$\\
\textbf{F} & $z$ & $w$\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Any coherent solution must be invariant under redescriptions of the
problem. So if you take a real world example that fits this category,
and relabel which option is E and which is F, the recommendation should
flip. And if you rescale the utilities by multiplying by a positive
constant or adding a constant, the verdict should be unchanged, since
utilities are only defined up to positive affine transformation. The
only theories that meet these constraints say that a choice has a
`score' \(x + my\), where \(x\) is the equilibrium payoff, and \(y\) is
the other possible payoff, and \(m\) is a free variable the theory sets
which reflects how much it cares about the value of the non-equilibrium
payoff. The theory then says to pick the option with the higher score,
or to be indifferent otherwise. So it says to strictly prefer E to F iff
\(x + my > w + mz\) and to be indifferent between the choices if that's
an equality not an inequality. Setting \(m\) to 0 gives you the view
that says one should always Hunt, since one should always pick the
equilibrium with the highest equilibrium value. Setting \(m\) to 1 gives
you the view that you should always Gather, since you should maximise
the sum (or, equivalently, the average) of the two payouts you might get
with the choice. And both of these views violate \textbf{The Core
Premise}. But what should we say about views that give \(m\) other
values?

The first thing to say is that it is very hard to see any good
philosophical motivation for values of \(m\) other than 0 or 1. Both
these values make a certain amount of sense, but the reasons behind any
other value are harder to understand. Still, if coherence required some
other value for \(m\), I'm sure someone would come up with a motivation.

The second thing to say is that we have done more already than object
just to the theories that set \(m\) to 1 or 0. Any theory that has
\(m < \frac{2}{3}\) will say that Amsterdam should choose A and Brussels
should choose B, violating \textbf{The Core Premise}. And any view that
has \(m > \frac{46}{47}\) will say that Amsterdam should choose B and
Brussels should choose A, also violating \textbf{The Core Premise}. But
we don't yet have an objection to theories on which
\(\frac{2}{3} \leq m \leq \frac{46}{47}\).

To see what's wrong with those theories, keep the structure of the game
the same, but change the rewards as follows (all rewards are in
dollars).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Human Pick & Doctor Pick & Human Reward & Doctor Reward \\
\midrule
\endhead
None & Opt-out & 0 & 1 \\
A & A & 4 & 4 \\
A & B & 0 & 0 \\
B & A & 2+\(\frac{1}{m}\) & 0 \\
B & B & 2 & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Then the `late game' that Amsterdam faces will look like this:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}r|cc}

\textbf{ } & \textbf{PA} & \textbf{PB}\\
\midrule
\textbf{A} & 4 & 0\\
\textbf{B} & $2+1/m$ & 2\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Since \(2 + m(2+\frac{1}{m}) > 4 + 0m\) for any value of \(m\)
satisfying \(\frac{2}{3} \leq m \leq \frac{46}{47}\), the theory will
say Amsterdam should choose B.\footnote{More slowly, we can use the
  formula to work out the score of each option. The score of A is the
  value in the top-left, 4, plus \(m\) times the value in the top-right,
  0. And that's 4, no matter the value of \(m\). The score of B is the
  value in the bottom-left, 2, plus \(m\) times the value in the
  bottom-left, \(2 + \frac{1}{m}\). That is, the score is
  \(2 + (1 + 2m) = 3 + 2m\). Since \(m > \frac{1}{2}\), this value is
  greater than 4, which was the score of A.}

The `early game' that Brussels faces will look like this:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{>{}r|cc}

\textbf{ } & \textbf{PA} & \textbf{PB}\\
\midrule
\textbf{A} & 4 & 0\\
\textbf{B} & $2+1/m$ & 1\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Since in this game Player gets nothing if Doctor opts-out, and there is
a 50/50 chance the Doctor will opt-out if they predict B, the returns in
the right-hand column are half what they are in the late game. Since
\(4 + 0m > 1 + m(2+\frac{1}{m})\) for any value of \(m\) satisfying
\(\frac{2}{3} \leq m \leq \frac{46}{47}\), the theory will say Brussels
should choose A.\footnote{More slowly, we can use the formula to work
  out the score of each option. The score of A is the value in the
  top-left, 4, plus \(m\) times the value in the top-right, 0. And
  that's 4, no matter the value of \(m\). The score of B is the value in
  the bottom-left, 1, plus \(m\) times the value in the bottom-left,
  \(2 + \frac{1}{m}\). That is, the score is \(1 + (1 + 2m) = 2 + 2m\).
  Since \(m < 1\), this value is less than 4, which was the score of A.}

So any decisive theory will violate \textbf{The Core Premise} for some
choice pair or other. Hence all decisive theories are mistaken.
