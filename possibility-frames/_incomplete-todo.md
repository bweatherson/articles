- First, show that whenever $i > j$, then $\Diamond_i^{\rightarrow} A \rightarrow \Diamond_j^{\rightarrow} A$ is true on the model.
- Second, consider the proposition $\neg \Diamond_0^{\rightarrow} p \vee \bigvee_k ((p \wedge \Diamond^{\leftarrow}_{k+1} T) \vee (p \wedge \neg \Diamond^{\leftarrow}_{k+1} T)).
- If the first disjunct is false, then $p$ is true somewhere in the right-handed tree. Let $k$ 


THIS IS ALL WRONG

What we need is the right-to-left arrow to be diamond_{k+i}, for positive i, with the disjunction ranging over possible values for i.
If there is a p-world, then there is one where it splits, but the split might not be straight away
