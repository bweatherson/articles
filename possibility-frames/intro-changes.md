# Changes to YAML and Introduction

## YAML

1. **Date updated**: `Feb 22 2026` → `Feb 23 2026`. Also updated the `\cehead` line in the PDF header to match.
2. **Abstract added**: Replaced placeholder with a summary of the paper's contribution.
3. **Trailing whitespace**: Removed trailing space after `Brian Weatherson` on the author name line.

## Introduction

### Direct changes

4. **Paragraph 1, sentence 1**: Removed comma before the title "From Worlds to Possibilities". The comma after "paper" is sufficient; adding one before the title as well creates an awkward double-punctuation around "1981 paper".
5. **Paragraph 2**: `[271-2]` → `[271--2]`. En-dash is standard for page ranges in academic citations.
6. **Paragraph 3**: `the story where Sherlock Holmes was introduced` → `the story in which Sherlock Holmes was introduced`. More formal register; "where" is locative and slightly off when the antecedent is a story rather than a place.
7. **Paragraph 3**: `It's not that _A Study in Scarlet_ is a story.` → `It's not just that _A Study in Scarlet_ is a story.` Without "just", the sentence appears to deny that the work is a story, which is the opposite of what's meant.
8. **Paragraph 3**: `It has proper parts which are stories` → `It has proper parts that are stories`. "That" is preferred for restrictive relative clauses.
9. **Paragraph 3**: `a story, one which tells` → `a story, one that tells`. Same reason as above.
10. **Paragraph 3**: `a proper part of larger story` → `a proper part of a larger story`. Missing article.
11. **Paragraph 4**: `if one things of` → `if one thinks of`. Typo.

### Flags for author consideration

12. **Paragraph 1**: The phrase "the many possible applications it has" is slightly awkward at the end of the sentence. Consider something like "a survey of its many possible applications" for a smoother close.
13. **Paragraph 2**: The paragraph opens with "Mathematically, possibilities are just points in a model, just like possible worlds are points in different kinds of models." The double "just" is a bit noticeable. Consider changing one of them (e.g., "much as possible worlds are points...").
14. **Paragraph 3**: The parenthetical `(first)` in "how many (first) cousins Holmes has" is a little distracting. It might read more smoothly without it, or with a brief explanatory note if the distinction matters.
