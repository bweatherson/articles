# Changes to Conclusion

## Direct changes

1. **Line 368**: `possibilties` → `possibilities`. Typo.
2. **Line 368**: `many more things that we could imagine` → `many more things we could imagine`. Removed unnecessary "that".
3. **Line 370**: `As I briefly alluded to` → `As I alluded to`. Removed "briefly" — "alluded" already implies brevity, and "briefly" also appears later in the same paragraph ("I'll end by briefly mentioning").
4. **Line 370**: `about open future` → `about the open future`. Added article.
5. **Line 372**: `Any (coherent) fiction` → `Any coherent fiction`. Parentheses around "coherent" are unnecessary; the qualification doesn't need to be flagged as an aside.
6. **Line 372**: `the unfortunate triple, which Lewis is committed to, of it being true` → `the unfortunate triple, to which Lewis is committed, of its being true`. Moved the preposition "to" to avoid stranding it at the end of the relative clause (which is awkward here because "to" is followed by a comma and then "of", creating a pileup). Changed "it being" to "its being" (gerund takes possessive).

## Flags for author consideration

7. **Line 368**: "I've gone over two more uses of the possibilities framework" — "two more" implies two in addition to some already discussed. But the paper has three substantive sections before the conclusion (formal structure, the determinability proof, and conditionals). If the "two more uses" refers to the determinability result and conditionals, that's fine, but "two more" suggests they're additions to a previously established list. You might consider whether "two uses" (without "more") is clearer, or whether the sentence should reference what the two uses are being counted in addition to.

8. **Line 372**: The fiction paragraph is suggestive but compressed. Two potential loose ends:
   - The claim that any coherent fiction picks out a particular possibility is doing a lot of work. Does "coherent" mean logically consistent, or something weaker? And does the conjecture extend to fictions with internal contradictions (e.g., unreliable narrators, time-travel paradoxes)?
   - The final sentence about the "distinctive relationship between a story and its sequel" is intriguing but unexplained. If you don't plan to develop it, it might be better to cut it, since as written it reads as a promissory note without enough content for the reader to see why possibilities would help.

   These are clearly flagged as future work, so it may be fine to leave them gestural. But the sequel point especially might benefit from a clause explaining what the intuition is.
