# Introduction

Use stories as the way in
Note there is a connection to sets of worlds
We'll first do some propositional modal logic, then quantifiers, then applications
Go over the big points, including persistence


# Modal Definability

State three conditions on R
Holliday objects these are too strong, note the powerset possibilization issue
He works with 'full possibility frames' which satisfy weaker conditions
Shows that can define a novel logic; can Humberstone frames?
Answer, yes if we allow infinitary disjunction
And, unlike in full possibility frames, doing so doesn't immediately create problems classically
Then go over proof

# Quantifiers and Expressive Power

Start with the point about Holmes's cousins
    There's something we can say in metalanguage not in object language
Go over the options for \forall
None of them are precisely what we want, but still, it works
    For the same reason infinitary disjunction works
    
# Applications

## Fiction

Can have a world of a story (like the belief world)
Don't need Lewis type operators, which generate slightly odd ambiguities
Also have a neater account of sequels

## Vagueness

Like supervaluationism, but without the need for precisifications
Also has a response to the mad-dog supervaluationism that Lewis (1993) worries about
Lacks some expressive capacities; like Fine can't say of a case that it's borderline

## Metaphysical Vagueness

Doesn't presuppose that the vagueness is exclusively in the representations
That goes back to Russell, but it's always been a bit tricky to make sense of
Need to say something about the metaphysics of representations that works
See Barnes & Williams for current-ish refs
Evans's argument against vague identity
Lewis's interpretation that this is because has to be metalinguistic
Humberstone frames approach - there is no way of stating indeterminate in the object language
But this is not because all indeterminacy is meta-linguistic

## Conditional Excluded Middle

Maybe look up in the Connectives
Also note Cariani and Goldstein (2020)
Intuition one: inferences support CEM
Intuition two: no nearest world
Synthesis: There is a nearest *possibility*, it has multiple refinements

## Identity of Indiscernibles

Goodman's argument that CEM implies that the spheres are not qualitatively identical
If the nearest possibility is unrefined, this doesn't look like it goes through
Arguably, the solution here is that counterfactual properties are not qualitative?

## Contingentism and Neccessitism

Huge topic, can't do justice here
But note that there is an interesting compromise position
Fixed domain models usually say that it's a requirement that every name get a referent in every world
Our requirement is that every name gets a referent in some refinement of every possibility
That suffices for classical first order logic
You get the boxes and quantifiers statement of necessitism
But you also have possibilities where some things are not in the domain, which is what the contingentist wanted
It's just like, as with the modal realist, ordinary quantification has to be understood as restricted
It's classical logic without classical semantics
Will this work? Who knows! But it's good to have options
