# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

I've gone over two more uses of the possibilities framework, but there are many more things we could imagine using it for. I'll end by briefly mentioning two of them.

As I alluded to in @sec-conditionals, possibilities can do a lot of work that philosophers have tried to make supervaluations do. As well as using possibilities instead of supervaluations in preserving Conditional Excluded Middle, it's worth exploring whether they are useful in thinking about vagueness, or about the open future.

@Humberstone1981a mentions that possibilities do a better job than possible worlds at making sense of talk about 'belief worlds'. We could say the same thing about the worlds of fiction. David @Lewis1978b ends up treating the operator _In this fiction_ as box-like, because he thinks otherwise we'd have to make arbitrary choices about some details of how the story is to be filled out. Using possibilities here seems smoother. Any coherent fiction, I conjecture, picks out a particular possibility. That will always be a less than fully refined possibility, but a possibility nonetheless. On this approach we don't get left with the unfortunate triple, to which Lewis is committed, of its being true in the story that $A \vee B$, but false that it's true in the story that $A$, and false that it's true in the story that $B$. I also think there might be some uses of possibilities in characterising the distinctive relationship between a story and its sequel.

But I'll leave those tasks for another day. The main point of this paper is to remind the reader how many uses Humberstone's notion of a possibility has, and to explore what happens to the logic of possibilities when we add quantifiers or infinitary connectives.
