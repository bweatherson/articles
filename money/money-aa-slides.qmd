# Two Theories about Money

## Institutional

![Searle's 1995 book (actually the 2010 reissue from a rare books site)](searle_book.png){width=40%}

## Institutional

> That a piece of paper with certain physical traits is a dollar bill is an institutional fact. But its existence depends on the existence of other institutional facts, such as the United States of America, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, etc. (Louis Larue)

## Functional

{{< video https://youtu.be/embed/dgct3Jn8pFA >}}

## Functional 

|  — Aww, $20?! I wanted a peanut!
|  - $20 can buy many peanuts!
|  — Explain how!
|  — Money can be exchanged for goods and services.

My view: the last line of that is right.

## Function without Institutions

- Company scrip.
- Monnaie à cours libre.
- Maybe in the future: crypto.

## Institutions without Function

- Hyper-inflation.
- Failed states.

## Different Boundary Conditions

- Other people's institutions might do, e.g., dollarisation in 1990s Russia. (I think Ecuador is a different case.)
- English and Scottish bank notes both keep working some distance the 'wrong' side of the border.
- US dollars work in several Canadian border towns, especially Niagara Falls. 

## Vague Boundaries

- The reach of English and USian financial institutions is sharply bounded.
- But the reach of their money is rather vague.

## Which is Right

When they come apart, seems to me the functional view gets it right.

- Someone who has US dollars in Niagara Falls or 1990s Moscow has money.
- Someone who has out of date marks in 1923 Weimar has wallpaper.

## Appeal of Institutional Theory

It's better (though still not actually right) as a theory of **currency** than a theory of money.

## Money is not (only) Currency

![Infographic from the Bank of England](boe_infographic.png){width=70%}

I use money every day, and currency every few weeks.

## History

- Currency is a relatively recent invention; maybe 2700 years ago.
- Money goes back much further than this.

## What is Money

- Money is what you Venmo to other people. 
- Money is what you keep in the bank. You don’t keep *your* currency in the bank. 
- It's what you exchange for goods and services. 

## Exchange and Currency

Sometimes the best thing to use for a transaction is currency.

But actually Apple Pay works better.

## Institutional Theories of Currency

These are *better* than institutional theories of money, but still not right.

The _monnaie a cours libre_ is still a counterexample.

## Overgeneration

Problem: Anything can be exchanged for goods and services, at least some of the time.

# Keynes and Liquidity

## Keynes

## Three Famous Books

- Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919)
- Treatise on Probability (1921)
- General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936)

Actually the middle isn't that famous outside philosophy, but still.

## The Interest in the General Theory

One of the moving parts in the General Theory is an account of what causes the rate of interest.

The short version is that it is the amount that must be given to creditors in exchange for their loss of liquidity.

## The Money in the General Theory

In a modern economy, we typically (in fact almost exclusively) borrow money.

In a loan, the borrower gets money, and the lender gives it up.

And the reason the lender must be compensated is for their loss of liquidity. This all suggests a theory.

## The Money in the General Theory

In chapter 17 (which is what this talk is really about), Keynes says that money is the thing that has a high excess of

> **liquidity premium**

over

> **carrying costs**

## Three Properties of Investments

1. Yield - what you get from the investment
2. Carrying costs - how much it costs to hold the investment
3. Liquidity premium - how much it benefits you that the investment is liquid.

In practice the boundary between negative contributions to yield and positive contributions to carrying costs is blurry - this actually raises problems that I'll skip in the interests of time.

## Two Investors

|:------|-------:|
| Income | $100,000 |
| Expenses | $30,000 |
| Profit | $70,000 |
 
: House 

|:------|-------:|
| Income | $50,000 |
| Expenses | $0 |
| Profit | $50,000 |

: Bank Deposit

## What Not Option A?

Because something might go wrong.

If it does, B has the resources to meet it.

A has to go through a messy sale process, that takes time, loses value on the investment, costs a 6% commission, and probably takes 90 days to clear.

## Liquidity Premium

The liquidity premium of the second investment is roughly how much better the bottom line on the left has to be to make it, all things considered, a better investment.

## Liquidity Premium

So that's the liquidity _premium_, but what is _liquidity_? 

As I understand it, the liquidity of a good is its ability to be 

1. **easily exchanged** for 
2. **many things** in 
3. **many circumstances**. 
 
## Easily Exchanged

Low transaction cost.

No brokers commission or Coinstar fee.

No paying someone to advertise for the buyers.

## Many Things

You can trade the good for a lot of different things.

A Starbucks gift card can be easily exchanged for coffee like substance, but not so easily for beer.

## Many Circumstances

The good will keep having those properties in a wide range of realistic scenarios.

Tesla stocks are easily exchanged for many things (provided you have a credit card and you've set up your stock sales to go straight to your credit card bill), but they can't be exchanged if the stock falls a lot.

## Tesla Stock

![Buys a lot less beer than you might have hoped](tesla.png){width=80%}

## Examples

A bank account linked to a credit card and a Venmo account. 

. . .

Definitely money. Really the paradigm of money. You can buy practically anything this way, and it will only fail in scenarios where everything else has failed as well.

## Examples

A briefcase full of banknotes. 

. . .

Mostly money. 

The carrying costs are non-trivial - you’ve got to do some work to keep it secure - and there are some things you can’t really buy with it - e.g., you can’t pay your hospital bills this way. 

## Examples

A suitcase full of pennies.

. . .


Not money. 

The carrying costs are immense. I mean literally, try lifting that thing let along carrying it. And no one in their right mind will take it as payment. 

## Examples

A shoebox full of Walmart gift cards. 

. . .

Mostly money. 

You can trade it for most things - literally Walmart sells most things. And you could probably get close to face value for it without too much effort if you really wanted something Walmart didn't sell.

## Examples

_Monnaie a cours libre_, the private currencies issued by the local notables in French municipalities in the early 1790s. 

. . .

Mostly money. 

For most purposes, these can be traded for goods and services, so they are money. That they only work in a very small geographic region does reduce their liquidity premium, especially if one is liable to be conscripted to an army based in far away Paris.

## Examples

A large box of cigarettes in an old-fashioned prison. 

. . .

Money. 

I mean, this is really in the movies prisons. But in the movies you could trade those things for anything that was for sale. This is not 2024 America prison consulting advice, and for that you should contact an actual prison consultant. (Yes that's a real job, probably a well paying one.)

## Examples

A Robinhood account with the money all in overnight Treasuries. 

. . .

Money, and a very special kind of money. 

It’s money that is not barren, contra the assumptions Keynes makes in chapter 17 of the _General Theory_ that money is barren. 

It makes 5.25% right now, but is still easy to use to pay off credit card bills, which means anything you can buy on credit card, it can be easily exchange for.

## Examples

A Robinhood account with the money in a volatile stock, like Tesla. 

. . .

Not quite money. 

It’s just too unstable to know that it will be there in a crunch, and money should be somewhat stable.

## Examples

    A Robinhood account with the money in index funds. Maybe money. This one is hard, and I’m not sure. It would be a weird result for Keynes if it turned out to be money, but maybe it sort of actually is. Index funds are so much more stable than individual stocks, and they are otherwise very liquid.

The last one is surprising enough that you might think it’s a counterexample to the theory. But since they can be easily exchanged for goods and services, I suspect we should just accept that they are a strange form of money. Why wouldn’t they be?

One reason is that they have a highly volatile purchasing power. That’s why we didn’t count shares of individual stocks as money. They might not be there in an emergency. Except the emergencies that lead to a material loss in purchasing power for an index fund are pretty rare. Not brain-in-vat rare, but rare. And it’s not like we require zero inflation for currency to count as money, so some volatility in purchasing power is consistent with money-ness.

It’s true that on a day-to-day basis, currency (and bank accounts) have more stability of purchasing power than index funds. But I’m not sure that’s true over anything but the shortest of terms. If you keep a briefcase full of banknotes in your safe for 3 years, that’s probably more likely to lose 20% of its purchasing power than an index fund is. So volatility can’t prevent the index fund being money unless the briefcase is also not money.

Another reason is that you can’t directly trade the index fund for beer, you have to make two transactions. Maybe you could say that money is that which can be directly traded for goods and services.

I suspect this won’t work because there isn’t going to be a plausible way to make the notion of ‘directness’ work. Buying things on credit card is a pretty indirect process. More importantly, precisely how indirect it is is one of those bits of financial plumbing that ordinary people sensibly don’t care about. If how much money one had turned on just how direct the process was by which credit card payments were made, people should care about it. But most importantly, it’s not like ordinary credit card payments are completely simple. A credit card payment isn’t just tapping a card at the store - you also have to make the monthly payment on the bill. It’s two transactions. And going from index funds in a Robinhood account to beer isn’t really any harder than buying the beer on credit card and then paying the credit card statement.
State Money

So is the state unimportant in all this? No, the state matters, but indirectly. If the state is minimally functional, then the currency it issues will have a high excess of liquidity-premium over carrying-costs. Moreover, since the state will typically take only what it issues6 as payment for taxes, anything else will have a dent in its liquidity. But being money is being able to be exchanged for goods and services; that is, having a liquidity-premium. And the state makes money by making things have a liquidity-premium, not by simple declarations.
Two Open Questions

This is more than long enough for one week. I’ll end with two things that I’ll hope to come back to when I have more time/wisdom.

First, in a world where some forms of capital provision to enterprises are essentially money, what is the Keynesian explanation of slumps? The very short version of the General Theory is that slumps happen when the providers of capital have such a great demand for liquidity that they won’t build enough things that employ people. Can that happen in a world like ours where one can simultaneously provide investment capital and have liquid funds?

Second, what’s the relationship between liquidity-premium and the risk/uncertainty distinction, or (what I think is the same thing) the precise/imprecise probability distinction. Keynes links the discussion of liquidity-premium in chapter 17 to his Treatise on Probability, and in particular the discussion of weight in chapter 6 of the Treatise. What could the link be?

On the one hand, it seems like you can have liquidity preference in a world with just risk. I didn’t have to talk about Keynesian/Knightian uncertainty in the earlier example of the two investors. On the other hand, maybe there’s a more subtle argument here.

Some days I think Keynes has the following view in mind. If there was only risk, all the premises of Aumann’s Agreement Theorem would be in place, so everyone would know the expected monetary value of each investment good, and everyone would know that everyone would know that, so there would be an agreed upon market price for (all? most?) investment goods, so they would be liquid. From this perspective, it’s only because of uncertainty that anything is ever illiquid, so anything else has a liquidity-premium. But whether Keynes really thinks that, and whether it’s plausible, are for future posts.
