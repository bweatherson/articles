    <p>There are extremely strong age and period effects in citations in philosophy journals. The age effect is that citations are concentrated on articles published two to five years prior. The period effect is that recent years have seen an explosion in the number of articles published, and the number of citations per articles, so many articles are getting more citations per year than they ever had previously. But cohort effects are trickier to detect. In this note I argue that they exist. There are more citations to articles from eras of more dramatic change in philosophy, such as around 1970 and around 2010. And there are fewer citations to articles from periods of consolidation, especially in the late 1970s through the 1980s.</p>

<section id="sec-introduction" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Before looking at the data, here are two things I believed about philosophy citations. First, philosophers tend to cite very old papers. We still regularly teach a number of papers over half a century old in introductory classes; e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="Frankfurt1969">(<a href="#ref-Frankfurt1969" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Frankfurt1969?</strong></a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Thomson1971">Thomson (<a href="#ref-Thomson1971" role="doc-biblioref">1971</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Singer1972">(<a href="#ref-Singer1972" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Singer1972?</strong></a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Lewis1973x">(<a href="#ref-Lewis1973x" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Lewis1973x?</strong></a>)</span>. These aren’t taught as history papers, but as early entries into the contemporary philosophical debate. And, I thought, that’s how we cite. Second, the technological changes of the last quarter century meant that this practice was being slowly reversed. The spread of electronic communication in the late 20th century, and then the rise of archives (e.g., Arxiv, SSRN, PhilPapers) and eventually journals publishing in EarlyView, meant that papers could now be cited even before they were published, and certainly without the delays involved in printing and posting journals around the world.</p>
<p>Both of these thoughts were wrong. Historically, philosophy papers have tended, when they are citing other philosophy papers, to cite very recent ones. But this tendency is diminishing, not increasing, over time. I’ll offer much more evidence for these claims as we go along, but to make them plausible, I’ll start with two simple graphs.</p>
<p>The data for the graphs come from citation data I downloaded concerning XXX papers published from 1955-2021,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in one hundred leading philosophy journals. I focussed on the citations to and from journals in this dataset. So every citation is from one of these 100 journals between 1955 and 2021, and to one of these 100 journals between 1955 and 2021. (The details of the journals, including when they start getting indexed for this dataset, are in <strong>?@sec-methodology</strong>.) In total, that gives us YYY citations.</p>
<p>Say the <em>age</em> of a citation is the difference between the publication year of the citing article and the cited article. So if an article published in 1998 cites an article published in 1985, that’s a 13 year old citation.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig-overall-age" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> I’ve plotted the number of citations in the dataset with each possible age. As you can see, it’s very heavily tilted towards the left-hand edge. It is true that people still cite <span class="citation" data-cites="Frankfurt1969">(<a href="#ref-Frankfurt1969" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Frankfurt1969?</strong></a>)</span>. Indeed, it’s one of the most cited papers in the last ten years. But it’s just one paper; the bulk of citations are to recently published papers which, if history is any guide, will soon stop collecting citations.</p>

<p>In <a href="#fig-overall-median-mode" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> I’ve plotted the median (on the left) and mode (on the right) age of citations in each year from 1980 onwards. Before that the numbers are even lower, but since I’m only looking at citations to articles published after 1955 (or later if Web of Science started indexing the journal later than that), this is arguably an artifact of how I’m collecting the data. From 1980 onwards, however, there are many older articles that could be, but are not, getting cited. The upwards trends in both graphs look like a real change in citation practices, and not in the direction I antecedently expected.</p>

<p>There is a third surprise in the data, but it’s a little more equivocal, and I’m not sure what to make of it. The 2010s seemed like, and to be honest still seem like, something of a golden age for philosophy. In metaphysics we saw the biggest paradigm shift in many years, away from modality and towards grounding. We saw the growth of important fields of social philosophy, including social epistemology, social metaphysics, and social philosophy of language. Though there were some earlier papers that have become important to the latter two fields (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="Haslanger2000">(<a href="#ref-Haslanger2000" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Haslanger2000?</strong></a>)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="Langton1993">(<a href="#ref-Langton1993" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Langton1993?</strong></a>)</span>), it would have been a stretch to even call them ‘fields’ before 2010. Social epistemology was always a bit bigger, and you could point to earlier field defining work by, e.g., Jennifer <span class="citation" data-cites="Lackey200x">(<a href="#ref-Lackey200x" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Lackey200x?</strong></a>)</span> and Adam <span class="citation" data-cites="Elga2007">Elga (<a href="#ref-Elga2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>. But it grew phenomenally in the 2010s. I’d predicted that would show up in higher citations to work in the 2010s, as these changes were consolidated. The data are a bit messy, and it would be good to have much more data, but this does not look to have happened. There isn’t as neat a graph for this, however, and we’ll return to this point at the end.</p>

<section id="sec-apc-described" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Age, Period, and Cohort</h1>
<p>To help understand the citation patterns, I’ll borrow some terminology that’s common in both sociology and medicine. Imagine that we see, in the historical record, some interesting patterns among teenagers in the late 1960s, and we’re wondering what could explain the pattern. Two types of pattern spring immediately to mind, along with ways to test them.</p>
<p>First, the behaviour could be explained by the fact the people involved are teenagers. If so, it is an <strong>age effect</strong>. The natural way to test this is to see if similar patterns show up with teenagers at different times.</p>
<p>Second, the behaviour could be explained by the fact that it was the 1960s, and lots of striking things happened in the 1960s. If so, it is a <strong>period effect</strong>. The natural way to test this is to see if the same pattern shows up with non-teenagers in the 1960s.</p>
<p>There is an important third kind of explanation. The people involved are born in the early 1950s, so they are part of the post-war baby boom. Colloquially, they are boomers. Maybe that could explain the pattern we see. If so, it is a <strong>cohort effect</strong>. The natural way to test this is to see if the same pattern shows up if we look at the same people in other stages of their life.</p>
<p>It’s easy to overlook the importance of cohort effects. Sometimes they simply look like age effects. <span class="citation" data-cites="GhitzaEtAl2023">Ghitza, Gelman, and Auerbach (<a href="#ref-GhitzaEtAl2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> argue that many hypotheses about age effects on voting, e.g., that older people are more naturally conservative, are really just cohort effects. <span class="citation" data-cites="Bump202x">(<a href="#ref-Bump202x" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Bump202x?</strong></a>)</span> argues that understanding the distinctive role the boomers in particular play is crucial for understanding many aspects of modern American life.</p>
<p>There are mathematical reasons that it is hard to tease these effects apart too. Many statistical techniques for separating out influences start to fall apart when there are linear correlations between combinations of variables. In this case there is as tight a correlation as is possible. By definition, cohort plus age equals period. There are some things you can do to get around this problem - see <span class="citation" data-cites="KeyesEtAl2010">Keyes et al. (<a href="#ref-KeyesEtAl2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> for a useful survey of some of the options - but it remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Even conceptually, it is hard to separate out these three effects in cases where there is evidence that the strength of the effects changes over time. As I noted at the start, the natural way to test hypotheses about which effect is strongest involve looking at other times. That works well when the age effects are constant. When they are not (and they might not be here), it is harder.</p>
<p>For most of our story, however, it helps just to have these three effects in mind. Using them, we can summarise the data reasonably quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The age effect is that articles get cited most when they are two to five years old, as shown in <a href="#fig-overall-age" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>.</li>
<li>The period effect is that there are many more citations in recent years than in earlier years. This is in part because the number of articles published in these journals has been growing, and in part because the number of citations per article grew substantially over the 2000s and 2010s, and exploded in the 2020s.</li>
<li>The cohort effect is that articles from the 1970s and 2000s get cited more than you’d expect given these age and period effects, articles from before the late-1960s get barely cited at all, and articles from 1980 through the mid-1990s also get cited considerably less than articles either side of that period. I’ll offer some speculations at the end of the paper about the philosophical causes of, and consequences of, these cohort effects.</li>
</ul>

# Citation Ages {#sec-citation-ages}


There is so much data available in citation databases these days that making sense of it requires some combination of restriction and abstraction. Happily, there are a lot of ways to restrict and abstract that lead to valuable insights on the structure of recent philosophy. This paper restricts attention to citations in philosophy journals (as opposed to books, chapters, dissertations etc.), and also just to citations of other philosophy journals. It abstracts by (for the most part) ignoring all information about a citation except the date of the cited article, and the date of the citing article. This may look like it's throwing out not just the baby along with the bathwater, but much more besides. But it helps us see the way that philosophers over time have related to prior times, and the way that journal articles have aged.

The first thing I'll do is construct a function *c*(*x*, *y*), which measures how often, on average, a paper published in year *x* is cited in year *y*. Then I'll go on to discuss several factors that explain why *c* has the values that it does.

The organising principle of the paper is that it helps to think about *c* using the notion of age, cohort and period effects. These kinds of effects are most commonly considered when investigating human populations. Imagine that you are investigating some historical records, and see something surprising when you look at teenagers in the late 1960s. What could explain the surprising result? It could be an age effect: because they were *teenagers*. It could be a period effect: because it was the *1960s*. Or it could be a cohort effect: because they were *boomers*.

There are two big technical problems with teasing these explanations apart. One is that a single data point doesn't distinguish between the three possible explanations. Another is that because there is a linear relationship between the variables, since age is just period minus cohort, simple statistical tests don't always tease the effects apart.^[See @KeyesEtAl2010 for a useful survey of attempts to resolve this problem.]

It is, however, important to distinguish the effects. Casual observation of voting patterns across the English-speaking world would suggest that there is a major age effect on voting: older voters support more right-wing parties and candidates. But without careful analysis, it's hard to be sure that is true, and it isn't that (a) cohorts have stable voting patterns, and (b) for the last several decades cohorts have been getting less conservative. Such a theory would have a better chance of explaining why when Bill Clinton ran for the US Presidency, he did better among older voters than with any other age group.^[See @BestKrueger2012 for the survey results, and @GhitzaEtAl2023 for a recent attempt to separate age from cohort effects in US voting patterns.]

I'm looking at citations, not people, but we can apply the same general idea. Explanations of *c*(*x*, *y*) should take account the age of the citation, i.e., *y* – *x*, the period of the citation, i.e., *y*, and the cohort the citation comes from, i.e., *x*. The aim here is to see how much we can explain by those three factors, and what those explanations tell us about philosophy more broadly.

There is an unsurprising age effect, and one that I found much more surprising.

The unsurprising one is that articles in general are not cited before they are published, then (holding period effects fixed), they reach their peak citation rate a few years after publication, after which their citation rate falls away fairly quickly.

What's surprising is that while that broad pattern, quick rise followed by almost as quick fall, is persistent over time, the details have changed. In particular, as we get to later and later cohorts, the peak is *later* (4-6 years after publication not 2-3 years), it is *lower* (closer to 1.5 times typical citations rather than 2 times), and the decline from the peak is much slower. In all three respects, the citation curve has gotten much flatter over time. Prior to doing this study, I expected that the peaks would be earlier, because electronic publication meant that articles would be more quickly discovered. That is very much not what has happened.

The period effects are mostly unsurprising, though one thing did stand out. There are a lot more citations later in the dataset than earlier, because (a) there are more articles being published, and (b) there are more citations per article. Both of these factors rise are actually fairly constant from around 1980 to 2000, and then they rise steadily from 2000 onwards. Then around 2020 something striking happens: the number of citations per article rises dramatically, to almost double what it had been a few years earlier. There seems to have been a notable change in citation practices, and perhaps citation norms, just before the start of the pandemic.

The cohort effects are easier to visualise than to describe in words. @fig-cohortgraph shows how often articles from each year are cited relative to how often you'd expect them to be cited given age and period effects.

There are five 


This paper concerns citations of philosophy journal articles in other philosophy journal articles, and in particular, citations that are indexed in Web of Science. Via my home institution^[I'll say what that institution is when the paper is de-anonymised], I downloaded the full citation records for one hundred prominent English language philosophy journals from the time Web of Science started indexing them. And I looked at how often each of those articles cited each other. One simple way to summarise some trends in this data set is to ask for any pair of years, how often are articles published in the first year cited in articles published in the second year. For instance, here are two simple facts about the set of citations.





::: {.cell}

:::





- In 1993, articles published in 1980 were cited 66 times.
- In 2010, articles published in 2007 were cited 725 times.

Those numbers are very different; what could explain the change? There are three natural kinds of explanation available.

First, it could be an **age** effect. 2010 is only three years after 2007, while 1993 is thirteen years after 1980. Other things equal, articles are most frequently cited two to five years after publication. Before that they aren't widely enough known to be cited; afterwards they are old news.

Second, it could be a **period** effect. There were many changes between 1993 and 2010. More journals came into existence. More journals that had already existed were added to the Web of Science index, and so got included in the dataset. Citation norms have been changing, and the average number of citations per article, and especially the average number of citations to journal articles per article, have been growing rapidly. All of these factors could, in principle, explain the difference between the two values.

Finally, it could be a **cohort** effect. Maybe there is something about philosophy in 1980 which made articles published then less likely to get cited than articles published in 2007. This kind of effect is both harder to detect in the data, and harder to understand how it could be possible.

The point of this paper is to argue that the results we see, like the two values shown above, are best explained by looking at all three effects. I'll briefly note the evidence for age and period effects, because these are enormous and mostly obvious. Then the bulk of the paper will argue that there is still a cohort effect after accounting for age and period effects, and suggesting some explanations for why such an effect exists.

# Age, Period, Cohort {#sec-apc}

Age, period, and cohort effects are most commonly considered when investigating human populations. Imagine that you are investigating some historical records, and see something surprising when you look at teenagers in the late 1960s. What could explain the surprising result? It could be an age effect: because they were *teenagers*. It could be a period effect: because it was the *1960s*. Or it could be a cohort effect: because they were *boomers*.

There are two big technical problems with teasing these explanations apart. One is that a single data point doesn't distinguish between the three possible explanations. Another is that because there is a linear relationship between the variables, since age is just period minus cohort, simple statistical tests don't always tease the effects apart.^[See @KeyesEtAl2010 for a useful survey of attempts to resolve this problem.]

It is, however, important to distinguish the effects. @tbl-presidential shows the Democratic share of the two party vote in US Presidential elections from 1972-2008.^[The data is from @BestKrueger2012, who did a bit of work to standardise the results in light of changes to the ways exit polls were conducted over this time.]

The period effects in @tbl-presidential are rather pronounced. Democrats did better in their worst group in the landslide win of 2008 than they did with their best group in the landslide loss of 1972. There also looks to be a pronounced age effect. In many years, including 1972 and 2008, the Democratic share is strictly decreasing as one goes from younger to older voters. This looks like evidence for the conventional wisdom that voters get more conservative as they get older.^[There could be an age effect without any voter getting more conservative. If young Republicans don't vote, or old Democrats die earlier than old Republicans, you'd also get an age effect.] But looking at the middle rows of the table complicates this story. In 1988, 1992, and 2000, Democrats did better among voters over 60 than they did among any other age group. Why didn't the familiar age effects show up?

One hypothesis is that there is a large cohort effect here. Roughly, people whose formative political experiences was the Great Depression were (on average) much more disposed to vote for Democrats than people in other cohorts. This kind of cohort based story could be put forward either as alternative to the posited age effect, maybe the 2008 results just show that each generation was a little less conservative than the one before it, or as a supplement to it. That is, one might hold both that older people are more conservative than younger people, and that people who came of age in the Depression are less conservative than other people. The results we see, where Dukakis (in 1988) and Gore (in 2000) do almost equally as well with young and old voters, might be the interaction of these effects.^[For a recent careful attempt to tease apart these effects, see @GhitzaEtAl2023.]

That's the kind of explanation I'll be offering for citation trends. The age and period effects are substantial, but they need to be supplemented with a cohort effect to fully understand the trends.

# Methodology {#sec-methodology}

As noted above, the study here is based on the Web of Science database, which my institution makes available with a subscription. That is, it lets members of the institution download the full database for research purposes. This is a rather large collection of files; after de-compression they come to over a terabyte. I selected records that were marked as _articles_ (as opposed to discussion notes, book reviews, editorial matters, and so on), and whose category was either Philosophy or History & Philosophy of Science. I then selected by hand the hundred journals with the most entries which were (a) primarily English language, (b) not primarily history of science and (c) broadly 'analytic' rather than 'continental'. These were somewhat subjective choices, but the result was a reasonable collection of the journals which are most important for telling the story of a certain kind of philosophy over the last several decades. The list of journals, as well as the dates covered by the index, is shown in @tbl-list-of-journals.

The column 'First Year' is *not* the first year the journal published; it is the first year that Web of Science indexed the journal. This often makes a difference; because _Analysis_ isn't indexed before 1975, we don't get "Is Knowledge Justified True Belief?" [@Gettier1963], or much of the initial literature it generated. Still, we do have a lot of information to work with, as long as we're careful about the limitations. Similarly, the column 'Last Year' is not the last year the journal was published; thankfully most of these journals are still in operation. It's not even the last year that Web of Science has records for. For most of the journals, there were records for 2022, and even occasional records for 2023. But I stopped the study in 2021 because it was the last year we had something that felt close enough to a full year's data. 

The database is supposed to tell you, for each indexed article, which things it cites. The reliability of this is mixed, especially with citations that are in footnotes rather than in a bibliography. And the data needs a huge amount of cleaning. Eugenio @Petrovich2024 did a similar study to this one focussing on five high profile journals, and his first step was a rather extensive bit of data cleaning.^[See section 4.2.4 of his book for more details on the challenges he faced.]

That said, for one important class of citations the data seems fairly reliable (at least as far as I could check), and not in need of much cleaning. When the citation is to another article that Web of Science indexes, the database includes the internal reference number of the cited article. By simply filtering for references that have an internal reference of this kind, we can quickly get a fairly accurate record of when the articles in @tbl-list-of-journals cite other articles on the table.

The upside of this approach, as opposed to the more thorough approach that Petrovich used, is that it makes it practical to study a hundred journals over sixty years. The downside is that it means we don't see citations to anything other than journal articles, and articles in these journals in particular. Obviously a full study of the citations in philosophy journals would want to pay some attention to citations of _Philosophical Investigations_, _A Theory of Justice_, _On the Plurality of Worlds_, and many many other books. This is not that 'full study'. Instead it's an attempt to analyse an important part of the citation data; a part that happens to be much easier to access.

So for the most part the method used here is that I downloaded hundreds of XML files from Web of Science and ran some filters on them. This took a few hours – even modern computers struggle to analyse a terabyte's worth of information quickly – but it wasn't that sophisticated. There were only two other things I had to do to fix the data.

The way Web of Science handles the 'supplements' to _Noûs_, i.e., _Philosophical Perspectives_ and _Philosophical Issues_, was a little uneven. Some years these are recorded as being their own thing, i.e., with a source name of _Philosophical Perspectives_ or _Philosophical Issues_; and some years they are recorded as special issues of _Noûs_. When they were listed as special issues, the citations were extremely unreliable. Some high profile articles are recorded as having no citations until several years after publication. The bibliographic information for the articles themselves was also spotty. So I've manually removed all records that were listed as special or supplementary issues of _Noûs_ (and similarly removed the citations to those article that did get tracked).

The other big problem is that for several journals, 1974 is missing from the index. In a couple of cases, 1973 is also missing. And in one very important case, 1971 and 1972 are missing as well. That 'important case' is _The Journal of Philosophy_. Between 1971 and 1974 it published groundbreaking articles by Harry @Frankfurt1971, George @Boolos1971, Paul @Benacerraf1973, Jaegwon @Kim1973, Michael @Friedman1974, Isaac @Levi1974, and David Lewis [-@Lewis1971cen; -@Lewis1973ben]. This seemed like a break in the data that needed fixing if I was going to tell the story correctly. So I used JSTOR to find a full list of articles (as opposed to notes or book reviews) in _Journal of Philosophy_ in those years, and then looked through the citations in articles in @tbl-list-of-journals to see which citations were to one of those articles. This did mean I was using a different classification of publications into articles and non-articles, and there are some odd choices.^[Notably, the JSTOR list seemed to exclude the symposium centered around Kenneth Arrow's "Some Ordinalist-Utilitarian Notes on Rawls’s Theory of Justice"; I'm not sure why that was.] And it meant I had to do a fair bit of data cleaning just to track down references to those four years.^[A non-trivial chunk of the cleaning was sorting through the many and varied ways that philosophers have spelled Brian O'Shaughnessy's name over the years.] While I've strived to make the data as consistent as possible with the other years, it's possible that I haven't succeeded, and some discontinuities around the early 1970s are due to this discontinuity in how the data was acquired.

After all that, we are left with 112891 articles, from "Aristotle and the Sea Battle" [@Anscombe1956] to "Zooming Irresponsibly Down the Slippery Slope" [@Coren2021]. These articles collectively cite each other 397459 times.

# Period Effects {#sec-period}

Those  397459 citations are not distributed evenly over time. Instead, they grow rapidly. At the start, in 1956, there are only 5 citations. That's not too surprising; without the ability to cite preprints, there aren't going to be many citations of articles that have come out that year. By 2021, there are 56300. In @fig-citationsperyear, I show how these grew; the striking thing to me is the big jump between 2020 and 2021.

What explains this dramatic growth? Part of the explanation is that more articles are being published, and more articles are being indexed. @fig-articlesperyear shows how many articles are in the dataset each year.

That explains some of the growth, but not all of it. The curve in @fig-articlesperyear is not nearly as steep as the curve in @fig-citationsperyear. The number of (indexed) citations per article is also rising. In @fig-outboundcitations I've plotted the average number of citations to other articles in the dataset each year.

There are a few possible explanations for the shape of this graph.

At the left-hand edge, there are obvious boundary effects. Since we're only counting citations to articles published since 1956, it isn't surprising that there aren't very many of them per article in the 1950s. Since articles rarely get unpublished, there are more articles available to cite every year.

The next three explanations are a bit more speculative, and I've put them in increasing order of speculativeness.

First, the most casual perusal of philosophy journals over time will tell you that the number of citations is increasing. It is now commonplace to have bibliographies several pages long. This was considerably less common a few decades ago. There are more citations to indexed philosophy journals in part because there are more citations.

Second, it feels like the relative importance of _journals_, as opposed to books or edited volumes, in journal articles is growing. This study can't verify that, since I filtered out all citations to things other than journals. But the same kind of casual perusal that tells you three page bibliographies are more common than they used to be, also suggests that a greater percentage of those bibliographies consists of other journals.

There is a third factor I'd like to study, but again this dataset won't help much with it. Antecedently, I'd have guessed that the rate of citation of _non_-philosophy journals was increasing. In particular, philosophers seem to spend a lot more time discussing results in psychology now than they used to do. If that were true, it would encourage generate a downwards slope in @fig-outboundcitations, which obviously isn't what we see at the end. But maybe the rate of citations to all journals is growing even more rapidly than the rate of citations to philosophy journals. That will be left as a study for another day.

Although the number of citations is going up, the number of articles available to be cited is also going up. Say an article is _available_ if it is published in a year iff it is published in or before that year. That's not quite right in either direction; some articles are cited before publication, some articles that come out in December aren't in any real sense available to be cited in January. But it's close enough. Say an article is from a year that is _typically_ cited iff it is between 3 and 10 years before the citing year. This notion will play a big role in @sec-age; I'm going to use these as a way of getting something like a base rate for citations in a given year. Using these definitions, @fig-articlecounts shows how many articles are available to be cited each year, and are from years that are typically cited.

In @fig-citationcounts, I've shown how often, in each year, the available articles, and the 'typical' articles are cited. The 'available' graph is obviously similar to @fig-citationsperyear; under 1% of citations are to articles published in future years. One thing that will be useful in @sec-age is that the graphs in @fig-citationcounts have a similar shape.

Putting all these together we can work out how often, on average, available articles, and typical articles, are cited in each year. The results are in @fig-citationrate.

Three things stand out about @fig-citationrate. One is that the two graphs have pretty similar shapes. Using citations from 3 to 10 years prior to the citing year is a pretty good proxy for all citations, and it turns out to be stable in other ways. A second is that both graphs are fairly flat for a long time. Between the mid 1970s and early 2000s they bounce around without moving much. Then they take off, and go through the roof in 2021. The other thing is that these are low numbers. For most of this study, an arbitrary article in one of these hundred journals was cited in one of those journals once a _decade_. Actually, since citation rates are extremely long-tailed, and mean rates are well above medians, that somewhat overstates how often the 'average article' was being cited. Frequent citation is very much not the norm.^[In the long run the average number of times an article is cited equals the average number of citations per article. So it shouldn't be too surprising that most article have just a handful of citations in philosophy journals.]

The various period effects are substantial; to get an reliable picture of the trends in citation patterns, we're going to have to allow for them.

# Age Effects {#sec-age}

The size of the period effects would suggest that we can't work out age effects by simply taking averages over the whole dataset. Surprisingly, if we do use the simplest possible method of working out age effects, we get roughly the right result.

Let's start with that simplest possible method. Say the _age_ of a citation is the time in years between the publication date of the citing article, and the publication date of the cited article. Then we can calculate the number of citations with each possible age. The result of that is shown in @fig-rawage.





::: {.cell}
::: {.cell-output-display}
![The age distribution of citations in the dataset.](apc-2025_files/figure-html/fig-rawage-1.png){#fig-rawage}
:::
:::





The picture in @fig-rawage is fairly intuitive. Articles rarely get cited before they are published.^[Though in "Naive Validity, Internalization, and Substructural Approaches To Paradox" [@Rosenblatt2017], there are three citations to then forthcoming papers in Synthese which eventually appeared in 2021, giving them an age of -4.] Then they take a little bit of time to get noticed, before hitting their peak citations between 2 and 5 years after publication. After that it's a rapid, and then a slow, decline. For the classic articles, citations never really stop; @Anscombe1956 is cited by @Izgin2020. But most articles reach the end of their citation life sooner or, occasionally, later.

But the fact that @fig-rawage looks plausible shouldn't obscure the fact that this is a lousy methodology. Given how many of the citations are in the last few years, what this graph tells us is largely what citation practices with respect to age have been like in recent times. It could be that the overall picture is very different, once we look closely.

As it turns out though, this is roughly the right picture. I'll show that with some graphs that are a bit more careful about adjusting for the period effect.

The key notion is what I'm going to call the *citation ratio*. This is a function that takes two years, which I'll call _old_ and _new_, as input. Intuitively, it measures how often articles from _old_ are cited in _new_, normalised for how many articles are published in _old_, and what the citation practices are in _new_. More formally, it is the following ratio:

- The numerator is how often the average article in _old_ is cited in _new_. So we search the articles published in _new_, count up the number of citations of articles published in _old_, and divide by the number of articles published in _old_.
- The denominator is the rate a 'typical' article is cited in _new_. Remember that I'm defining, somewhat stipulatively, a typical article to be published between 3 and 10 years before _new_. So again we search the articles published in _new_, count the citations to articles published 3 to 10 years earlier, and divide by the number of articles originally published 3 to 10 years earlier.





::: {.cell}

:::





Let's illustrate this with an example, using 1985 as _old_ and 1997 as _new_. In 1997, indexed articles from 1985 were cited 95 times. There are 1573 articles published in 1985 in the index, so the numerator for the citation ratio is 95 / 1573, i.e., about 0.06. In the 3 to 10 years before 1985, there were 12191 indexed articles published. Those articles were, collectively, cited 1483 times in 1997. So the denominator, the average number of citations the typical article got in 1997, is 1483 / 12191, i.e., about 0.122. Putting those together, the citation ratio for 1985 in 1997 is (about) 0.496. 

In @fig-ageeffecttibble I've graphed this citation ratio for many pairs of years. In the graph, the individual graphs (the _facets_), are for each value of _old_, the x-axis is the value for _new_, and the y-axis is the citation ratio. Note that before 1965, we can't calculate the citation ratio because there isn't enough data to calculate the typical citation rate. So the y-axis starts at 1965. And for most years there are no dots on the left side of the graph, because I haven't calculated the citation ratio in years where _old_ is later than _new_; there are few enough of these cases that they are best left out.

:::
:::





There are several notable things about @fig-ageeffecttibble. The most important is that after some weird results in the early years, probably due to the small sample sizes, the graphs for each year look remarkably similar. The citation ratio takes a year or two to take off from zero, gets to its peak within two to four years after publication, and then declines. In earlier years, the rise and the fall are more rapid than in later years. This is actually a surprising result, and I'll come back in @sec-culture to why it might be. Still, it doesn't change that the shape of the curves is common enough to talk sensibly about an average curve. In @fig-ageeffecteverything, I've put most of the data from @fig-ageeffecttibble, with the x-axis now being age not the citing year, and the line showing the mean citation ratio by age. I say 'most' of the data because I didn't show the points for original publication years before 1975, where as you can see in the earlier graph, the data are much noisier with much smaller samples. But those years are used in the calculation of the average that's displayed.^[The graph also includes some 'jitter' to make the different points more easily visible. I've put each year of original publication in a different colour, with nearby years being in similar colours. But there are too many colours there to detect individual years, and we'll return to faceted graphs like @fig-ageeffecttibble when I want to highlight individual years.]

:::
:::





The mean curve in @fig-ageeffecteverything is really similar to the unadjusted age curve in @fig-rawage. This is what I meant earlier by saying that after a lot of calculations, we'd get back to the same aging curve that we got from the simplest possibe measure.

The calculations did have one really notable effect though. The unadjusted age numbers give us a sensible aging curve overall, but they give us an absurd aging curve for individual years. For most years in the dataset, the year they are most cited is not two to five years after initial publication; it is 2021. The point of the various adjustments in this section has been to make better sense of what's happening in individual years. 

The result is the striking lack of outliers in @fig-ageeffecteverything. All the individual data points are fairly close to the mean. There is some deviation, and there would be much more if I included the earlier years where the data is much noisier. The deviation there is will be the focus of much of the rest of this paper. Still, it's notable how consistent the age curve is, once we use citation ratio to account for period effects.

To end this section, I wanted to highlight two features of @fig-ageeffecttibble that are a little hard to see in the big graph. In @fig-peakratio, I've graphed the maximum value the citation ratio reaches for each year of initial publication. This is a bit misleading before 1965, because I don't have enough data to calculate citation ratios when the citing year is earlier than that, so it might have left off what would have been the high point. But from then on it's useful.

:::
:::





After the initial jump upwards, and the very high numbers in the mid-1960s, the trend is a decline. In @fig-peakratiotime I've graphed out which age those peaks are hit at, for different years of initial publication starting in 1963.

In @fig-peakratiotime, the graph is going slightly upwards. Putting these last two figures together, we get the claim I was gesturing at earlier: citation curves are getting flatter. The peaks are coming later, and they are lower.

# Cohort Effects {#sec-cohort}

So far we've seen how period effects and age effects between them can explain a lot of the trends we see in citation patterns. But there are systematic deviations from those patterns which remain. In @fig-fourdeviations, I've shown some of these. Each graph shows the citation ratio for articles published in a particular year, as compared to the average citation ratio at different ages.

In 1961 and 1985, the yearly values are predominantly below the mean line. In 1979 and 2007, they are predominantly above it, though this isn't true for the first few years of the 2007 data. Note that the graphs have different lengths. Everything stops in 2021. And the 1961 data is cut off a little on the left because we only start calculating citation ratios in 1965. That's why the line showing the mean is differently shaped that year.

For each of year of original publication, we can calculate the mean difference between the citation ratio for that year, and the mean citation ratio for articles that age. That tells us how often articles published that year are cited, compared to how often you'd expect them to be cited knowing just the age and period effects. The results are in @fig-cohort.

A couple of quick technical notes on @fig-cohort. I've added a smoothed curve over the graph to help make some of the features of it stand out. And in calculating the mean, I only included years where we had at least five years worth of data to calculate the mean age effect. So that means I haven't included what happens to 1955 papers when they are cited after 2016. There isn't nearly enough data to say what one would 'expect' the usual aging curve to be at those points.
