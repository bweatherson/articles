\title{When are Philosophy Articles Cited?}
\author{Anon}
\date{2025-06-14}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
It's natural to believe that philosophy citations are typically to long
ago pieces. We're still talking about philosophers from millenia ago.
More strikingly, we're still talking about papers from half a century
ago not as historical papers, but as part of the contemporary debate.
But a systematic look at the citation data shows that these cases are
outliers. Most citations are to recently published works. Surprisingly,
this is less true in recent years than it used to be. The effect of
electronic publishing and communication has been to make citations, on
average, older. After we adjust for the typical age of philosophy
citations, and this changing trend, it turns out that the 2000s were a
particularly influential time in philosophy publishing. Articles
published in that decade are cited more than earlier or later articles,
once we adjust for the typical times articles are cited, and the
changing patterns of citation. This is arguably related to broad changes
in the interests of philosophers, towards social philosophy, and
epistemology.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}

Before looking at the data, here are two things I believed about
philosophy citations. First, philosophers tend to cite very old papers.
We still regularly teach a number of papers over half a century old in
introductory classes; e.g., Frankfurt
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1969Y444700002}{1969a}), Thomson
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1971Y116900003}{1971}), Singer
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1972Z066400001}{1972}), Lewis
(\citeproc{ref-10.2307_2025310}{1973}). These aren't taught as history
papers, but as early entries into the contemporary philosophical debate.
And, I thought, that's how we cite. Second, the technological changes of
the last quarter century meant that this practice was being slowly
reversed. The spread of electronic communication in the late 20th
century, and then the rise of archives (e.g., arXiv, SSRN, PhilPapers)
and eventually journals publishing in EarlyView, meant that papers could
now be cited even before they were published, and certainly without the
delays involved in printing and posting journals around the world.

Both of these thoughts were wrong. Historically, philosophy papers have
tended, when they are citing other philosophy papers, to cite very
recent ones. But this tendency is diminishing, not increasing, over
time. I'll offer much more evidence for these claims as we go along, but
to make them plausible, I'll start with two simple graphs.

The data for the graphs come from citation data I downloaded concerning
125,324 papers published from 1955-2024, in one hundred leading
philosophy journals. I focussed on the citations to and from journals in
this dataset. So every citation is from one of these 100 journals
between 1955 and 2024, and to one of these 100 journals between 1955 and
2024. (The details of the journals, including when they start getting
indexed for this dataset, are in Section~\ref{sec-methodology}.) In
total, that gives us 509,004 citations.

Say the \emph{age} of a citation is the difference between the
publication year of the citing article and the cited article. So if an
article published in 1998 cites an article published in 1985, that's a
13 year old citation.

In Figure~\ref{fig-overall-age} I've plotted the number of citations in
the dataset with each possible age. As you can see, it's very heavily
tilted towards the left-hand edge. It is true that people still cite
Frankfurt (\citeproc{ref-Frankfurt1969}{1969b}). Indeed, it's one of the
most cited papers in the last ten years. But it's just one paper; the
bulk of citations are to recently published papers which, if history is
any guide, will soon stop collecting citations.

}

\caption{\label{fig-overall-age}Number of citations with each age.}

\end{figure}%

In Figure~\ref{fig-overall-median-mode} I've plotted the median and mode
age of citations in each year from 1980 onwards. Before that the numbers
are even lower, but since I'm only looking at citations to articles
published after 1955 (or later if Web of Science started indexing the
journal later than that), this is arguably an artifact of how I'm
collecting the data. From 1980 onwards, however, there are many older
articles that could be, but are not, getting cited. The upwards trends
in the first graph looks like a real change in citation practices, and
not in the direction I antecedently expected. The second graph also
trends slowly upwards until 2020, then suddenly drops.

\end{figure}%

There is a third surprise in the data, but it's a little more equivocal,
and I'm not sure what to make of it. After adjusting for the different
number of articles published in different eras, and different citation
practices in different eras, it looks like articles published in the
2000s are cited somewhat more than articles published earlier or later.
The data here are a bit more equivocal, and even getting to this result
requires making some modeling choices, but it looks like there is
something there. I'll come back to why this might be at the end.

\section{Age, Period, and Cohort}\label{sec-apc-described}

To help understand the citation patterns, I'll borrow some terminology
that's common in both sociology and medicine. Imagine that we see, in
the historical record, some interesting patterns among teenagers in the
late 1960s, and we're wondering what could explain the pattern. Two
types of pattern spring immediately to mind, along with ways to test
them.

First, the behaviour could be explained by the fact the people involved
are teenagers. If so, it is an \textbf{age effect}. The natural way to
test this is to see if similar patterns show up with teenagers at
different times.

Second, the behaviour could be explained by the fact that it was the
1960s, and lots of striking things happened in the 1960s. If so, it is a
\textbf{period effect}. The natural way to test this is to see if the
same pattern shows up with non-teenagers in the 1960s.

There is an important third kind of explanation. The people involved are
born in the early 1950s, so they are part of the post-war baby boom.
Colloquially, they are boomers. Maybe that could explain the pattern we
see. If so, it is a \textbf{cohort effect}. The natural way to test this
is to see if the same pattern shows up if we look at the same people in
other stages of their life.

It's easy to overlook the importance of cohort effects. Sometimes they
simply look like age effects. Ghitza, Gelman, and Auerbach
(\citeproc{ref-GhitzaEtAl2023}{2023}) argue that many hypotheses about
age effects on voting, e.g., that older people are more naturally
conservative, are really just cohort effects. Bump
(\citeproc{ref-Bump2023}{2023}) argues that understanding the
distinctive role the boomers in particular play is crucial for
understanding many aspects of modern American life.

There are mathematical reasons that it is hard to tease these effects
apart too. Many statistical techniques for separating out influences
start to fall apart when there are linear correlations between
combinations of variables. In this case there is as tight a correlation
as is possible. By definition, cohort plus age equals period. There are
some things you can do to get around this problem - see Keyes et al.
(\citeproc{ref-KeyesEtAl2010}{2010}) for a useful survey of some of the
options - but it remains a challenge.

Even conceptually, it is hard to separate out these three effects in
cases where there is evidence that the strength of the effects changes
over time. As I noted at the start, the natural way to test hypotheses
about which effect is strongest involve looking at other times. That
works well when the age effects are constant. When they are not (and
they might not be here), it is harder.

For most of our story, however, it helps just to have these three
effects in mind. Using them, we can summarise the data reasonably
quickly.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The age effect is that articles get cited most when they are two to
  five years old, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-overall-age}.
\item
  The period effect is that there are many more citations in recent
  years than in earlier years. This is in part because the number of
  articles published in these journals has been growing, and in part
  because the number of citations per article grew substantially over
  the 2000s and 2010s, and exploded in the 2020s.
\item
  The cohort effect is that articles from the 1970s and 2000s get cited
  more than you'd expect given these age and period effects, while
  articles from other times, most especially before 1965, but also
  around 1990, get cited less. The reasons for this are more
  complicated, and I'll return to them below.
\end{itemize}

As I mentioned above, I'll go over the methodology in detail in
Section~\ref{sec-methodology}. But there is one point that is important
to note before we start. I'm using data from Web of Science, and they
typically don't start indexing journals until well after the journal is
established. So the first year of citation data I have for
\emph{Analysis} is 1975. Crucially, that means that ``Is Knowledge
Justified True Belief?'' (\citeproc{ref-Gettier1963}{Gettier 1963}) is
not included in this study. If it were, and in general if I had the data
from \emph{Analysis} to work from, some of the results about the early
1960s would look less dramatic, though as far as I can tell, the
direction of the results wouldn't change.

\section{Period Effects}\label{sec-period}

Those 509,004 citations are not distributed evenly over time. Instead,
they grow rapidly. At the start, in 1956, there are only 5 citations.
That's not too surprising; without the ability to cite preprints, there
aren't going to be many citations of articles that have come out that
year. By 2024, there are 38,507. In Figure~\ref{fig-citationsperyear}, I
show how these grew.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{apc-2025-may-draft_files/figure-pdf/fig-citationsperyear-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-citationsperyear}The number of citations in the
dataset made each year.}

\end{figure}%

While I'll explain the full methodology later, it's worth pausing over
one point here. I used a slightly different method to extract the
citations from 2022 onwards. It's possible that the drop between 2021
and 2022 is a consequence of that change. However I don't think it is
for two reasons. First, it's more likely that 2021 is just an outlier;
it's a consequence largely of \emph{Synthese} publishing 1,439 articles
in 2021, then a relatively few 509 articles in 2022. Second, I applied
the method I'm using for 2022-2024 to 2020 and 2021, and got a fairly
close agreement (within 1-2\%) with each year.

What explains this dramatic growth, at least through 2021? Part of the
explanation is that more articles are being published, and more articles
are being indexed. Figure~\ref{fig-articlesperyear} shows how many
articles are in the dataset each year.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{apc-2025-may-draft_files/figure-pdf/fig-articlesperyear-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-articlesperyear}The number of articles in the
dataset published each year.}

\end{figure}%

That explains some of the growth, but not all of it. The curve in
Figure~\ref{fig-articlesperyear} is not nearly as steep as the curve in
Figure~\ref{fig-citationsperyear}. The number of (indexed) citations per
article is also rising. In Figure~\ref{fig-outboundcitations} I've
plotted the average number of citations to other articles in the dataset
each year.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{apc-2025-may-draft_files/figure-pdf/fig-outboundcitations-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-outboundcitations}The average number of citations to
indexed articles each year.}

\end{figure}%

There are a few possible explanations for the shape of this graph.

At the left-hand edge, there are obvious boundary effects. Since we're
only counting citations to articles published since 1956, it isn't
surprising that there aren't very many of them per article in the 1950s.
Since articles rarely get unpublished, there are more articles available
to cite every year.

That can't explain the massive jumps we see at the right hand edge of
Figure~\ref{fig-outboundcitations}. The jump there looks like the
convergence of two cultural trends. One is a trend simply to greater
numbers of citations. The most casual perusal of journals will confirm
that trend. The other is a trend to greater citations of journals
themselves, as opposed to books or edited volumes.

A sharp jump like this is a warning sign that there is something wrong
with the data, and so the data should be checked. It's impractical to
cross-check every entry, but those I have checked look correct. The
change seems led by the most prestigious journals. For each journal I
calculated the average number of outbound citations (to these hundred
journal) for both the 2010s, and the first two years of the 2020s. The
ten journals with the largest increase between the decades are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-large-growth}.

\end{longtable}

Since \emph{Philosophical Review} only publishes 10 to 12 articles per
year, it is not surprising that it shows the most variation on this
list. Still, the change in the 2010s isn't only small sample size
variation. Of the 22 articles it published in 2020 and 2021, only one of
them (\citeproc{ref-WOS000575210400003}{Oberman 2020}) had fewer than
14.8 outbound citations. With a sample of just 22 anything could happen,
but it would be surprising to have all but one end up on the same side
of the historical average by chance.

Although the number of citations is going up, the number of articles
available to be cited is also going up. Say an article is
\emph{available} if it is published in a year iff it is published in or
before that year. Say an article is from a year that is \emph{typically}
cited iff it is between 3 and 10 years before the citing year. This
notion will play a big role in what follows. Using these definitions,
Figure~\ref{fig-articlecounts} shows how many articles are available to
be cited each year, and are from years that are typically cited.

\end{figure}%

In Figure~\ref{fig-citationcounts}, I've shown how often, in each year,
the available articles, and the `typical' articles are cited. The
`available' graph is obviously similar to
Figure~\ref{fig-citationsperyear}; under 1\% of citations are to
articles published in future years. One thing that will be useful in
Section~\ref{sec-age} is that the graphs in
Figure~\ref{fig-citationcounts} have a similar shape.

\caption{\label{fig-citationcounts}Citation counts.}

\end{figure}%

Putting all these together we can work out how often, on average,
available articles, and typical articles, are cited in each year. The
results are in Figure~\ref{fig-citationrate}.

\begin{figure}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\centering{

\end{minipage}%

\caption{\label{fig-citationrate}Mean annual citations to different
article kinds.}

\end{figure}%

Three things stand out about Figure~\ref{fig-citationrate}. One is that
the two graphs have pretty similar shapes. Using citations from 3 to 10
years prior to the citing year is a pretty good proxy for all citations,
and it turns out to be stable in other ways. A second is that both
graphs are fairly flat for a long time. Between the mid 1970s and early
2000s they bounce around without moving much. Then they take off, and go
through the roof in 2021, before returning to their long term trend. The
other thing is that these are low numbers. For most of this study, an
arbitrary article in one of these hundred journals was cited in one of
those journals once a \emph{decade}. Actually, since citation rates are
extremely long-tailed, and mean rates are well above medians, that
somewhat overstates how often the `average article' was being cited.
Frequent citation is very much not the norm.\footnote{In the long run
  the average number of times an article is cited equals the average
  number of citations per article. So it shouldn't be too surprising
  that most article have just a handful of citations in philosophy
  journals.}

The various period effects are substantial; to get an reliable picture
of the trends in citation patterns, we're going to have to allow for
them. The project here is to use citation data as a proxy for
philosophical influence. It is, of course, a deeply imperfect proxy. But
it is better than most other proxies; it is certainly better than going
off of vibes, or of what one's friends are talking about.\footnote{In
  North America, placement on graduate syllabi might be an even better
  proxy, but that data is hard to collect, and we'd need a different
  measure for other countries.} If we're going to use citations this way
though, we need to think about how to take into account the changes
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-citationsperyear}.

The measure I'll use is this: an article's influence in a period is the
ratio of how often it is cited (in that period), to how often a typical
article is cited (in that period), where `typical' here means 3-10 years
old. This is a little arbitrary, but I think it gets things roughly
right. I tried several other measures, and they all either led to
implausible trends in the data, or to comparative judgments about the
influence of various papers that didn't seem remotely plausible. This
measure had the nice consequence that how influential the leading 50
articles from a period were 10-20 years after that period was reasonably
stable, suggesting that it does correct for period effects reasonably
well.

\section{Age Effects}\label{sec-age}

The simplest way to work out age effects just uses the values in
Figure~\ref{fig-overall-age}. For any two articles with age \emph{x} and
\emph{y}, we should adjust for age-effects by taking their citations at
that age as something like the proportion of all citations of articles
with that age as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-overall-age}. Given how
dramatic the period effects are, this makes no theoretical sense
whatsoever. And it would get various details wrong. Somewhat
surprisingly, it would nevertheless be roughly correct.

The picture in Figure~\ref{fig-overall-age} is fairly intuitive.
Articles rarely get cited before they are published. Then they take a
little bit of time to get noticed, before hitting their peak citations
between 2 and 5 years after publication. After that it's a rapid, and
then a slow, decline. For the classic articles, citations never really
stop; W. van O. Quine (\citeproc{ref-WOSA1956CEQ2500001}{1956}) is cited
by Liefke (\citeproc{ref-WOS000784599200001}{2024}). But most articles
reach the end of their citation life sooner or, occasionally, later.

Still, we'd like to be sure that what we're seeing in
Figure~\ref{fig-overall-age} isn't just a side-effect of the period
effects, or something about how the articles are aggregated. That's what
I'll try to do in this section.

The key notion is what I'm going to call the \emph{citation ratio}. This
is a function that takes two years, which I'll call \emph{old} and
\emph{new}, as input. Intuitively, it measures how often articles from
\emph{old} are cited in \emph{new}, normalised for how many articles are
published in \emph{old}, and what the citation practices are in
\emph{new}. More formally, it is the following ratio:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The numerator is how often the average article in \emph{old} is cited
  in \emph{new}. So we search the articles published in \emph{new},
  count up the number of citations of articles published in \emph{old},
  and divide by the number of articles published in \emph{old}.
\item
  The denominator is the rate a `typical' article is cited in
  \emph{new}. Remember that I'm defining, somewhat stipulatively, a
  typical article to be published between 3 and 10 years before
  \emph{new}. So again we search the articles published in \emph{new},
  count the citations to articles published 3 to 10 years earlier, and
  divide by the number of articles originally published 3 to 10 years
  earlier.
\end{itemize}

Let's illustrate this with an example, using 1985 as \emph{old} and 1997
as \emph{new}. In 1997, indexed articles from 1985 were cited 95 times.
There are 1539 articles published in 1985 in the index, so the numerator
for the citation ratio is 95 / 1539, i.e., about 0.062. In the 3 to 10
years before 1985, there were 12210 indexed articles published. Those
articles were, collectively, cited 1478 times in 1997. So the
denominator, the average number of citations the typical article got in
1997, is 1478 / 12210, i.e., about 0.121. Putting those together, the
citation ratio for 1985 in 1997 is (about) 0.51.

In Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-early} and
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-late} I've graphed this citation ratio
for many pairs of years. In the graph, the individual graphs (the
\emph{facets}), are for each value of \emph{old}, the x-axis is the
value for \emph{new}, and the y-axis is the citation ratio. Note that
before 1965, we can't calculate the citation ratio because there isn't
enough data to calculate the typical citation rate. So the y-axis starts
at 1965. And for most years there are no dots on the left side of the
graph, because I haven't calculated the citation ratio in years where
\emph{old} is later than \emph{new}; there are few enough of these cases
that they are best left out.

\end{figure}%

There are several notable things about
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-early} and
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-late}. The most important is that after
some weird results in the early years, probably due to the small sample
sizes, the graphs for each year look remarkably similar. The citation
ratio takes a year or two to take off from zero, gets to its peak within
two to four years after publication, and then declines. In earlier
years, the rise and the fall are more rapid than in later years. This is
actually a surprising result, and I'll come back in
Section~\ref{sec-culture} to why it might be. Still, it doesn't change
that the shape of the curves is common enough to talk sensibly about an
average curve. In Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecteverything}, I've put most of
the data from those two figures, with the x-axis now being age not the
citing year, and the line showing the mean citation ratio by age. I say
`most' of the data because I didn't show the points for original
publication years before 1975, where as you can see in the earlier
graph, the data are much noisier with much smaller samples. But those
years are used in the calculation of the average that's
displayed.\footnote{The graph also includes some `jitter' to make the
  different points more easily visible. I've put each year of original
  publication in a different colour, with nearby years being in similar
  colours. But there are too many colours there to detect individual
  years, and we'll return to faceted graphs like
  Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-early} and
  Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-late} when I want to highlight
  individual years.}

\begin{figure}

\centering{

}

\caption{\label{fig-ageeffecteverything}Age effects from 1970 onwards on
a single graph, with the overall averrage shown.}

\end{figure}%

The mean curve in Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecteverything} is really similar
to the unadjusted age curve in Figure~\ref{fig-overall-age}. This is
what I meant earlier by saying that after a lot of calculations, we'd
get back to the same aging curve that we got from the simplest possibe
measure.

The calculations did have one really notable effect though. The
unadjusted age numbers give us a sensible aging curve overall, but they
give us an absurd aging curve for individual years. For most years in
the dataset, the year they are most cited is not two to five years after
initial publication; it is 2021. The point of the various adjustments in
this section has been to make better sense of what's happening in
individual years.

The result is the striking lack of outliers in
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecteverything}. All the individual data points are
fairly close to the mean. There is some deviation, and there would be
much more if I included the earlier years where the data is much
noisier. The deviation there is will be the focus of much of the rest of
this paper. Still, it's notable how consistent the age curve is, once we
use citation ratio to account for period effects.

There are two particularly interesting features
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-early} and
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-late} that are a little hard to see in
the big graph. In Figure~\ref{fig-peakratio}, I've graphed the maximum
value the citation ratio reaches for each year of initial publication.
This is a bit misleading before 1965, because I don't have enough data
to calculate citation ratios when the citing year is earlier than that,
so it might have left off what would have been the high point. But from
then on it's useful.

}

\caption{\label{fig-peakratio}The maximum citation ratio in each facet
in Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-early} and
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecttibble-late}.}

\end{figure}%

After the initial jump upwards, and the very high numbers in the
mid-1960s, the trend is a decline. In Figure~\ref{fig-peakratiotime}
I've graphed out which age those peaks are hit at, for different years
of initial publication starting in 1963.

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{\label{fig-peakratiotime}For each original publication year,

\end{figure}%

In Figure~\ref{fig-peakratiotime}, the graph is going slightly upwards.
Putting these last two figures together, we get the claim I was
gesturing at earlier: citation curves are getting flatter. The peaks are
coming later, and they are lower.

Finally, while I've stressed how little variation there is between
years, I'll end this section by noting how much variation is between
papers. In Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecteverything-high} and
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecteverything-low} I've shown what happens to
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecteverything} if we first restrict attention to
articles with 15 or more citations, and then to articles with fewer than
15 citations.\footnote{I picked this threshold because there are
  approximately as many citations to articles with at least that many
  citations as to the other articles.} Obviously in the first graph the
values will be higher; highly cited articles are, indeed, cited more
often. But what I want to highlight here is the different shape of the
curves.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{apc-2025-may-draft_files/figure-pdf/fig-ageeffecteverything-high-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-ageeffecteverything-high}A version of

articles}

}

\caption{\label{fig-ageeffecteverything-low}A version of
Figure~\ref{fig-ageeffecteverything} just looking at not so highly cited
articles}

\end{figure}%

Both graphs rise rapidly to a peak two to five years after publication,
and then descend. But from that similarity, the differences are
striking. For the highly cited articles, there is barely any dropoff by
years 8 to 10. For the others, the dropoff starts in earnest in year 4,
and by year 10, the average value is half of the peak. That graph
doesn't quite go to 0, but mostly these articles are not making much
impact after a couple of decades. On the other hand, for the highly
cited articles, the age effects are very gradual. Several decades after
their publication, they are (on average) being cited 2/3 as often as at
their peak (adjusting for period effects).

I think there is an important lesson in this. If the way you think about
citations in philosophy comes from looking the history of famous
articles, you'll get a misleading impression. The citation pattern for a
highly cited article isn't like the citation pattern for a regular
article, just scaled up. It has a very different temporal structure.

None of this a priori. There could be relatively rarely cited articles
that get frequently cited long after their publication. Indeed, there
are such papers in the database. Norman Malcolm's ``Dreaming and
Scepticism'' (\citeproc{ref-WOSA1975KG87100002}{Curley 1975}) didn't get
much attention in the journals when it was first published, but has been
picked up a bit recently because of an increase in work on dreams. And
there could be articles that are the center of attention for a while
then get many fewer citations after a decade. Some papers on
supervenience fit that description (e.g., Difrisco
(\citeproc{ref-WOS000443474300002}{2018})), as well as some papers in
philosophy of science, where there is perhaps more rapid progress. But
in general, highly cited articles are highly cited not because they have
a flurry of activity, but because they remain part of the conversation
for years after publication.

\section{Cohort Effects}\label{sec-cohort}

So far we've seen how period effects and age effects between them can
explain a lot of the trends we see in citation patterns. But there are
systematic deviations from those patterns which remain. In
Figure~\ref{fig-fourdeviations}, I've shown some of these. Each graph
shows the citation ratio for articles published in a particular year, as
compared to the average citation ratio at different ages.

\begin{figure}

\end{minipage}%

\caption{\label{fig-fourdeviations}Mean annual citations to different
article kinds.}

\end{figure}%

In 1961 and 1985, the yearly values are predominantly below the mean
line. In 1979 and 2007, they are predominantly above it, though this
isn't true for the first few years of the 2007 data. Note that the
graphs have different lengths. Everything stops in 2024. And the 1961
data is cut off a little on the left because we only start calculating
citation ratios in 1965. That's why the line showing the mean is
differently shaped that year.

For each of year of original publication, we can calculate the mean
difference between the citation ratio for that year, and the mean
citation ratio for articles that age. That tells us how often articles
published that year are cited, compared to how often you'd expect them
to be cited knowing just the age and period effects. The results are in
Figure~\ref{fig-cohort}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{apc-2025-may-draft_files/figure-pdf/fig-cohort-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cohort}Cohort effects for different publication
years.}

\end{figure}%

A couple of quick technical notes on Figure~\ref{fig-cohort}. I've added
a line showing the rolling average (four years either side of the point,
or as much of those four years are available) to help make some of the
features of it stand out. And in calculating the mean, I only included
years where we had at least five years worth of data to calculate the
mean age effect. So that means I haven't included what happens to 1955
papers when they are cited after 2019. There isn't nearly enough data to
say what one would `expect' the usual aging curve to be at those points.

On the face of it, there are five periods in the graph.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Journal articles published before the mid-1960s are very rarely cited.
\item
  After that, and especially in the early 1970s, a flurry of very highly
  cited articles are published.
\item
  Then there is a period of stagnation, where things mostly don't return
  to the lows of per-1965, but are consistently below 0.
\item
  There is an uptick starting in the mid-1990s, and peaking dramatically
  in 2007.
\item
  Then there is a rather dramatic drop off, almost immediately after the
  high of 2007.
\end{enumerate}

The first couple of trends make sense; the latter three less so. The
rest of this paper (before the methodology section) will be about
explaining what's going on here, and seeing what it can tell us both
about the history of philosophy, and the history of the philosophy
profession.

Before 1965, the philosophical work with the most lasting significance
was not done in journals. And those works of lasting significance that
were in things one might call journals often are not indexed by Web of
Science. So we don't have ``Is Knowledge Justified True Belief?''
(\citeproc{ref-Gettier1963}{Gettier 1963}) because they don't index
\emph{Analysis} until 1975, and we don't have Austin's two most
important papers - ``Ifs and Cans'' and ``A Plea for Excuses''
(\citeproc{ref-Austin1956}{Austin 1956a},
\citeproc{ref-Austin1956b}{1956b}) because their venues aren't indexed
as journals at all. We do have important papers by Frege
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1956CHJ4400001}{1956}), W. van O. Quine
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1956CEQ2500001}{1956}), Grice
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1957CGZ6000005}{1957}), Anscombe
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1958CDL1000001}{1958}), Smart
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1959CGZ6600001}{1959}), and Davidson
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1963CEU0700001}{1963}). But these made much less
impact than books from the same time, especially \emph{Intention}
(\citeproc{ref-Anscombe1957}{Anscombe 1957}), \emph{Word and Object}
(\citeproc{ref-Quine1960}{W. V. O. Quine 1960}) and \emph{The Structure
of Scientific Revolutions} (\citeproc{ref-Kuhn1962}{Kuhn 1962}).

Then starting in the late 1960s, almost every area of philosophy got
turned upside down, with much of the action happening in journals. The
two most important works of the period, \emph{A Theory of Justice}
(\citeproc{ref-Rawls1971}{Rawls 1971}) and \emph{Naming and Necessity}
(\citeproc{ref-Kripke1980}{Kripke {[}1972{]} 1980}), were not in
journals. But articles in journals did make revolutionary changes in
many fields, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Free will (\citeproc{ref-WOSA1969Y444700002}{Frankfurt 1969a},
  \citeproc{ref-10.2307_2024717}{1971});
\item
  Practical ethics (\citeproc{ref-WOSA1971Y116900003}{Thomson 1971};
  \citeproc{ref-WOSA1972Z066400001}{Singer 1972});
\item
  Meaning and reference (\citeproc{ref-10.2307_2025079}{Putnam 1973});
\item
  Philosophy of mathematics (\citeproc{ref-10.2307_2025075}{Benacerraf
  1973});
\item
  Causation (\citeproc{ref-10.2307_2025310}{Lewis 1973};
  \citeproc{ref-10.2307_2025096}{Kim 1973}); and
\item
  Personal identity (\citeproc{ref-WOSA1971Y036400001}{Parfit 1971})
\end{itemize}

As well there were a surprising number of papers that weren't as
influential straight away, but came to play a big role the later
literature. This group includes papers by Fred Dretske
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1970ZE33800001}{1970}), David Lewis
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1970ZE32700001}{1970}), Kendall Walton
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1970Y384700002}{1970}) and Larry Wright
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1973P242100001}{1973}). That's all to say that the
story that Figure~\ref{fig-cohort} tells about the early 1970s is
plausible. There had never before been a period when there was such a
quantity of high quality work being done in philosophy journals.

To see what is happening after that time, though, we need to look a
little more closely at the data. Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-short} is a
version of Figure~\ref{fig-cohort} just focussing on the first seven
years after publication. That is, for each publication year, it measures
citations of articles published that year in the seven years after they
were published, adjusted in the same way for age and period effects.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{apc-2025-may-draft_files/figure-pdf/fig-cohort-short-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cohort-short}A version of Figure~\ref{fig-cohort}
restricted to citations from the first seven years after publication.}

\end{figure}%

Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-short} is measuring how often articles from a
year are cited, soon after publication, compared to articles cited
before them and, to a lesser extent, immediately after them. So the high
numbers in the early 1960s are not showing that articles from that time
were highly cited in an absolute sense, just that they were cited much
more than articles from the 1950s were.

After that boom, and the one-off year of 1973, things are reasonably
steady through the mid-2000s. Then, especially after 2007, there is a
massive drop. Why is that happening? Part of the answer is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-long}, which is the same measure but only for
citations after the first seven years.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{apc-2025-may-draft_files/figure-pdf/fig-cohort-long-1.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cohort-long}A version of Figure~\ref{fig-cohort}
restricted to citations from after the first seven years after
publication.}

\end{figure}%

The differences between Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-short} and
Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-long} are striking. After both graphs go up in
the early 1970s, and down in the early 1980s, they are strongly
anti-correlated. Between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, short term
citations are up, and long term citations are down. After around 1995,
short term citations start cratering, and long term citations are as
high as ever.

So what we're seeing on the right hand edge of Figure~\ref{fig-cohort}
is primarily an artifact of two things. On the one hand, citations are
getting older, which means that the typical article is getting more of
its citations long after publication. On the other hand, for articles
published fairly recently, we simply don't have the data for that time
`long after publication'; it hasn't happened yet.

This doesn't quite explain everything. The graph in
Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-long} does seem to stop rising in the 2010s. But
it explains most of the graph. The main reason Figure~\ref{fig-cohort}
falls away so fast at the end is not that articles in the 2010s are
getting cited at historically low rates. It's that citations are
shifting from the first few years after publication to later in time,
and for those articles, our data includes the period the citations are
shifted from, and not the period the citations are shifted to.

Even if that's right, there are still some questions to answer.

Why is this temporal shift in citations happening? Shouldn't technology
be causing the shift to happen in the other direction? I'll discuss this
in Section~\ref{sec-technology}.

Why are citations in general rising so much, even after allowing for
increases in the number of articles published? Some of the reason for
that will become clear in Section~\ref{sec-technology}, but there are
two cultural factors that I'll discuss in Section~\ref{sec-culture}.

Finally, why do the times around 1990 and 2005 stand out? Around 1990 we
see an upward spike in Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-short}, and a low point in
Figure~\ref{fig-cohort-long}. Around 2005, both graphs are above their
long term trends. The answers here are partially due to the
technological factors discussed in Section~\ref{sec-technology}, and the
cultural factors discussed in Section~\ref{sec-culture}. But they are
also due to an important change in which topics were philosophically
central. There is a hint here of an important discontinuity between
twentieth and twenty-first century philosophy, and I'll say more about
that in Section~\ref{sec-content}.

\section{Technology and Citations}\label{sec-technology}

As I noted at the top, I feel a common view is that the primary role of
electronic publication has been to speed up \emph{distribution}. This
view is not borne out by the data. If that were the case, you'd expect
to see short term, especially very short term, citations rising over
time.

Printing and postage was a pretty mature technology by the late
twentieth century. We weren't waiting for steam ships to bring the
latest issues of journals to distant shores. The technology used for
distributing philosophy journals was the same technology used for
distributing journals in medicine and other fields where time was of the
essence. From that perspective, the internet would only speed things up
by weeks, maybe months, and this wouldn't really show on a graph in
years.

What is perhaps more surprising is that the prevalence of Online First,
Early View, and other forms of quasi-publication haven't made more of a
difference. They do show up a little in the data, in that occasionally
articles are cited before their official publication. But there are few
enough of these citations that they make little difference.

The biggest effect of technology was not on distribution but on
\emph{search}. Before the widespread use of computers, there was a much
better system for searching books than for searching journal articles.
Classification systems meant books typically lived on shelves near other
books on the same topic. Card catalogues would list subject matters for
books. Even the title of the book could help track down what it was
about. Finding a journal article on a relevant topic was much harder.
And, it seems, it mostly wasn't done.

My impression is that there was also a notable physical difference
between the ways books and journals were stored and accessed. Almost
every academic has a bookshelf; not as many have large collections of
journals. Occasionally a department would have physical journals on
hand, but often the best way to access journals was to walk across
campus to a library. On the other hand, accessing a book might involve
walking four steps to a shelf. This physical difference probably
contributed to the relative prominence of books and articles in
bibliographies.

There often was an exception to this general claim about access. (At
least, this was true in any pre-twentieth century department I was
familiar with, but I think it was moderately widespread.) Departments
would sometimes keep the latest issues of journals in a department
library or common room. Those would be much more prominent, and easy to
access. I'm not sure whether this explains why so many of the journal
citations pre-1995 are to very recent journals, but it probably helped.

So that I think is part of the story. Before the widespread adoption of
computers, old journal articles were very hard to find. This changed a
little with the advent of electronic, and hence easily searchable,
versions of \emph{Philosophers' Index}, and changed a lot when journals
went online. And that's part of why older articles, and especially older
articles that are not classics, are now more widely cited.

\section{Culture Changes}\label{sec-culture}

Two important cultural changes made a difference to the citation
patterns, one to do with the role of journal articles, another to do
with citation norms.

If you look back to journals from a century ago, you sometimes see
pieces that feel more like blog posts than what we'd now consider
journal articles. Even more substantive pieces feel more like means to
an end. The journal article is as much a trial run for a book as it is a
report on a complete project.

By the twenty-first century, all of that is changed. Articles are
getting much longer, even in venues like \emph{Analysis}. More
importantly, they are often finished products, not draft runs for future
books. There are prominent philosophers whose reputation is based
largely, or even entirely, on articles (e.g., Jonathan Schaffer). There
are large fields of philosophy, e.g., epistemic contextualism and
metaphysical grounding, where the canonical texts of the field are
almost entirely articles not books. This isn't entirely new, the
post-Gettier literature on analysis of knowledge was largely
article-based too, but it's a growing trend. This is partially why
citations are getting older; if a field is based in articles, there will
be more citations to older articles. That's especially true when those
articles have not been superseded by books.\footnote{The list of
  articles that were once widely cited but are rarely cited now is
  heavily populated with articles that formed the basis for widely cited
  books.}

But the bigger trend is the increasing tendency of philosophers to
include brief citations to work they aren't discussing in detail, but
which locate the paper in a literature. Obviously if an article cites 26
other journal articles, as we saw in Table~\ref{tbl-large-growth} the
average recent \emph{Philosophical Review} paper does, it can't possibly
be discussing every one of them in depth. (Remember this count excludes
citations of books and articles in edited volumes.) For a long time a
striking difference between philosophy and nearby disciplines was the
lack of these citations that largely served to place a paper in a
literature. Their growth partially explains why citations are getting
older; if an author cites the history of their sub-field, that will
include some older articles.

But why did this change happen? Part of the story is technology, as
discussed in Section~\ref{sec-technology}. It's now much easier to do
this. But this can't be the whole story, since the practice was more
widespread in other fields before some of these technologies came on
board. Part of the story is the growth of specialisation. If you're
writing a paper on content externalism in the 1990s, you don't need to
include a citation trail going back to Kripke and Putnam. Everyone knows
the history of these debates, and it doesn't need to be rehashed. Since
then, it's become a little less clear that there is any field that all
readers will know the history of, so there's more need for background.

But a big part of the story, I'll argue, was the growth of
interdisciplinary work in the 2000s. This can be seen in a lot of
fields, including the rise of experimental philosophy, and the
increasing empirical sophistication in philosophy of mind. I'm going to
focus on one other aspect of this growth: the move of philosophy of
language towards debates that were also active inside linguistics. Part
of what we see in the 2000s is the adoption of citation norms from
linguistics into philosophy of language. I'm not going to argue for this
next bit in any detail, but the timeline is consistent with those norms
spreading from philosophy of language to the rest of the discipline.

I'm going to use two measures to look at the rise of interdisciplinary
philosophy of language in the 2000s. (Both of these measures will be
important in the next section too.)

\section{Content Changes}\label{sec-content}

Another part of the story is that the centre of gravity of philosophy
publishing changes over the time period we're looking at. And it does so
in a way that turns out to matter for which kinds of articles are cited.

Through at least the early 2000s, analytic philosophy is in what Sider
(\citeproc{ref-Sider2020}{2020, 2}) calls the ``modal era''. One aspect
of this era, one that Sider particularly highlights, is that questions
about essence were equated with questions about necessity in a way that
they weren't either before or after the era.\footnote{It was usual,
  during this era, to take the necessity of origins thesis and the
  origin essentialism thesis to not just be mutually supporting, but to
  be literally identical. I don't think that identity claim would be
  widely endorsed either before 1970 or after 2010.} This should be
taken as a symptom of the era, not the definition of it. What's really
defining of the era was the way modality became central to disputes
across the discipline.

Consider, for example, what Frank Jackson
(\citeproc{ref-Jackson1998}{1998}) called the `location problem', i.e.,
the problem of how to locate in the world something that the philosopher
thinks exists, and is not fundamental. Jackson argues that saying how to
locate the non-fundamental in the fundamental is a compulsory question
for anyone doing `serious metaphysics', and the one and only answer to
it will involve modality. As he says,

\begin{quote}
When does a putative feature of our world have a place in the account
some serious metaphysics tells of what our world is like? I have already
mentioned one answer: if the feature is entailed by the account told in
the terms favoured by the metaphysics in question, it has a place in the
account told in the favoured terms. This is hardly controversial
considered as a sufficient condition, but, I will now argue, it is also
a necessary condition: the one and only way of having a place in an
account told in some set of preferred terms is by being entailed by that
account---a view I will refer to as the entry by entailment thesis.
(\citeproc{ref-Jackson1998}{Jackson 1998, 5})
\end{quote}

Now Jackson went on to say other things about entailment that were not
widely endorsed. But at this early stage in the book, I think he was
largely expressing conventional wisdom. In a review that disagrees with
many parts of the book, Stephen Yablo
(\citeproc{ref-Yablo2000Jackson}{2000, 20}) says ``Not many eyebrows
will be raised by Jackson's view that metaphysics is committed to `entry
by entailment' theses.'' That is, the quoted parts are not
controversial, especially the one that Jackson flags as being ever so
slightly more controversial.

The idea that entailment, i.e., necessitation, had been central to
understanding how the non-fundamental relates to the fundamental had
been central to philosophy for many years by this point. (To be clear,
Jackson isn't claiming great novelty at this point of his book; the big
claim he's building towards is that the necessitation is a priori
knowable.) We can see just how central it is by using a slightly
different statistic to what I've used so far: grand-citations.

Say that the number of grand-citations an article \emph{a} has is the
number of triples ⟨\emph{a}, \emph{b}, \emph{c}⟩ such that \emph{c}
cites \emph{b} and \emph{b} cites \emph{a}. It's the sum of the number
of citations of articles that cite \emph{a}. If we look at
grand-citations over time, they show David Lewis's centrality to the
philosophy journals. Through 2021, six of the eight articles with the
most grand-citations are by Lewis. If instead we look at particular
times, we see the changing face of the journals. Grand-citations take
some time to accrue, so I'll look at twenty year periods. In particular,
for various years, I'll look at which articles published in the
preceeding twenty years had the most grand-citations through that year.

Table~\ref{tbl-grand-cite-2000} lists which articles, published from
1980 onwards, had the most grand-citations through 2000.

I've included the names of the articles on this table to make vivid how
central supervenience was to the literature at this time.\footnote{The
  story of the relationship between twentieth century work on functions
  and twenty-first century work on mechanisms is interesting, but for
  another time.} Four of the articles here have the word `supervenience'
in the title! At the center of this literature stood Jaegwon Kim. The
citation data I have somewhat \emph{underestimates} his influence,
because people often cited his edited collection \emph{Supervenience and
Mind} (\citeproc{ref-Kim1993}{\emph{Supervenience and Mind} 1993}), and
those citations are usually not tracked by Web of Science.\footnote{The
  most common explanation for a widely cited article to stop being cited
  is not that the focus of the literature moves away, but that the
  article is superseded by something else that author wrote.}

When we move into the 2000s, the focus shifts dramatically, as we see in
Table~\ref{tbl-grand-cite-2010}.

The biggest single topic over this time was contextualism in
epistemology, with the big papers by Lewis
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1996VY21200001}{1996}) and DeRose
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1995RC31600001}{1995}) at the center of things. What
I want to focus particularly on, though, is another DeRose paper on that
list: ``Epistemic Possibilities''. It has fewer cites than any other
paper there, but the fourth most grand-cites. The way this came about is
revealing of changes in the discipline, and particularly in citation
practices.

DeRose's paper is an important early contribution to debates about
epistemic modals that became very active in the 2000s. This activity was
partially due to the intrinsic interest of the subject. But it was also
due to the way that epistemic modals sit at the intersection of three
enormous debates that were going on at the time. One was epistemic
contextualism, which you can see the impact of in
Table~\ref{tbl-grand-cite-2010}. The second was about the nature of
context-sensitivity in language, with work by Stanley and Szabó
(\citeproc{ref-WOS000088616400001}{2000}) at the center of
it.\footnote{I won't include the full table, but if you created a table
  like Table~\ref{tbl-grand-cite-2010} for the twenty years through
  2015, Stanley and Szabó's paper would be on it.} And the third was
about the possibility of a modern form of relativism, with the central
figure here being John MacFarlane (\citeproc{ref-MacFarlane2014}{2014}).
Papers on epistemic modals were influenced by, and in turn influenced,
all three of these debates.\footnote{For particularly notable examples,
  see the papers by Andy Stanley and Szabó
  (\citeproc{ref-WOS000088616400001}{2000}), Seth Yalcin
  (\citeproc{ref-WOS000251545300007}{2007}), and Tamina Stephenson
  (\citeproc{ref-WOS000255667800003}{2007}).}

These debates had an impact on how citations worked in philosophy in a
few ways. One was in virtue of the fact that they were largely new
topics, there wasn't an established canon that writers could assume
familiarity with. So they needed to cite more papers to establish the
debate. It wasn't necessary to cite Putnam
(\citeproc{ref-10.2307_2025079}{1973}) or Kripke
(\citeproc{ref-Kripke1980}{{[}1972{]} 1980}) every time you wanted to
distinguish necessity from a priority; the reader in the 1990s could be
assumed to know where the distinction came from. But the reader in the
2000s could not be assumed to know about work by Fred Dretske
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1970ZE33800001}{1970}), G. C. Stine
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1976EK38300003}{1976}), or Stewart Cohen
(\citeproc{ref-WOSA1987K730800002}{1987}).

Perhaps more significant was that these debates, especially the second
and third, were much more interdisciplinary than debates about modality
had been. Many of the writers were primarily in linguistics, not
philosophy, and the philosophers were reading more linguistics than ever
before. The citation norms in linguistics, like in most other social
sciences, required more citations than the norms in philosophy did. They
didn't require more citation than the philosophy norms in the 2020s, but
much more than philosophy in the 1990s. So these debates, which became
important across a range of journals from the mid 2000s onwards, tended
to have many more citations than before.

To back up the claims in the last two paragraphs I need one more
statistic. (The last one I'll introduce in this essay!) This is a way of
adjusting for age, period, and cohort effects all at once.\footnote{I
  haven't used it above because using it doesn't help much in separating
  out the three effects.} For an article \emph{a} published in year
\emph{y}, say that the \textbf{weight} of its citations in year \emph{z}
is the number of times it is cited in \emph{z}, divided by the average
number of citations that articles in year \emph{y} get in \emph{z}. So
it's just the measure of how often the article is cited, compared to how
often you'd expect it to be cited knowing just the publication year and
citation year. We'll be interested in three statistics. The
\textbf{overall weight} of an article is the average of its weight over
each year between the year after its publication and 2024. The
\textbf{short-term weight} is the average of its weight over the seven
years after it was published. And the \textbf{long-term weight} is the
average of its weight from eight years after publication to 2024. For
individual articles, this measure is too noisy to be particularly
meaningful. If we take the averages of all articles published in a year,
the average weight at any time is, by definition, 1. So that's not much
help either. But for medium sized classes of articles, the average
weights can be interesting. In particular, looking at the average
weights of articles which cite some particular prominent article are
interesting.

This is a variant on grand-citations, and like grand-citations, it takes
some time to
