Historically, the norm was that most citations of journals in journals involved articles that had been published very recently. But the trend in recent years has been to cite fewer recent works, and more older works.

This paper has two parts. In the first part I set out the data backing up what I said in the previous paragraph. This takes some work since citation practices have changed so much over the years that figuring out a way to sensibly compare citations at different times is a bit tricky. In the second part I look at some reasons why these changes have occurred. These
