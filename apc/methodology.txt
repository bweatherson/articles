The column 'First Year' is *not* the first year the journal published; it is the first year that Web of Science indexed the journal. This often makes a difference; because _Analysis_ isn't indexed before 1975, we don't get "Is Knowledge Justified True Belief?" [@Gettier1963], or much of the initial literature it generated. Still, we do have a lot of information to work with, as long as we're careful about the limitations. Similarly, the column 'Last Year' is not the last year the journal was published; thankfully most of these journals are still in operation. It's not even the last year that Web of Science has records for. For most of the journals, there were records for 2022, and even occasional records for 2023. But I stopped the study in 2021 because it was the last year we had something that felt close enough to a full year's data.

The database is supposed to tell you, for each indexed article, which things it cites. The reliability of this is mixed, especially with citations that are in footnotes rather than in a bibliography. And the data needs a huge amount of cleaning. Eugenio @Petrovich2024 did a similar study to this one focussing on five high profile journals, and his first step was a rather extensive bit of data cleaning.^[See section 4.2.4 of his book for more details on the challenges he faced.]

That said, for one important class of citations the data seems fairly reliable (at least as far as I could check), and not in need of much cleaning. When the citation is to another article that Web of Science indexes, the database includes the internal reference number of the cited article. By simply filtering for references that have an internal reference of this kind, we can quickly get a fairly accurate record of when the articles in @tbl-list-of-journals cite other articles on the table.

The upside of this approach, as opposed to the more thorough approach that Petrovich used, is that it makes it practical to study a hundred journals over sixty years. The downside is that it means we don't see citations to anything other than journal articles, and articles in these journals in particular. Obviously a full study of the citations in philosophy journals would want to pay some attention to citations of _Philosophical Investigations_, _A Theory of Justice_, _On the Plurality of Worlds_, and many many other books. This is not that 'full study'. Instead it's an attempt to analyse an important part of the citation data; a part that happens to be much easier to access.

So for the most part the method used here is that I downloaded hundreds of XML files from Web of Science and ran some filters on them. This took a few hours – even modern computers struggle to analyse a terabyte's worth of information quickly – but it wasn't that sophisticated. There were only two other things I had to do to fix the data.

The way Web of Science handles the 'supplements' to _Noûs_, i.e., _Philosophical Perspectives_ and _Philosophical Issues_, was a little uneven. Some years these are recorded as being their own thing, i.e., with a source name of _Philosophical Perspectives_ or _Philosophical Issues_; and some years they are recorded as special issues of _Noûs_. When they were listed as special issues, the citations were extremely unreliable. Some high profile articles are recorded as having no citations until several years after publication. The bibliographic information for the articles themselves was also spotty. So I've manually removed all records that were listed as special or supplementary issues of _Noûs_ (and similarly removed the citations to those article that did get tracked).

The other big problem is that for several journals, 1974 is missing from the index. In a couple of cases, 1973 is also missing. And in one very important case, 1971 and 1972 are missing as well. That 'important case' is _The Journal of Philosophy_. Between 1971 and 1974 it published groundbreaking articles by Harry @Frankfurt1971, George @Boolos1971, Paul @Benacerraf1973, Jaegwon @Kim1973, Michael @Friedman1974, Isaac @Levi1974, and David Lewis [-@Lewis1971cen; -@Lewis1973ben]. This seemed like a break in the data that needed fixing if I was going to tell the story correctly. So I used JSTOR to find a full list of articles (as opposed to notes or book reviews) in _Journal of Philosophy_ in those years, and then looked through the citations in articles in @tbl-list-of-journals to see which citations were to one of those articles. This did mean I was using a different classification of publications into articles and non-articles, and there are some odd choices.^[Notably, the JSTOR list seemed to exclude the symposium centered around Kenneth Arrow's "Some Ordinalist-Utilitarian Notes on Rawls’s Theory of Justice"; I'm not sure why that was.] And it meant I had to do a fair bit of data cleaning just to track down references to those four years.^[A non-trivial chunk of the cleaning was sorting through the many and varied ways that philosophers have spelled Brian O'Shaughnessy's name over the years.] While I've strived to make the data as consistent as possible with the other years, it's possible that I haven't succeeded, and some discontinuities around the early 1970s are due to this discontinuity in how the data was acquired.
