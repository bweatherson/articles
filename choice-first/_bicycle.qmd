Say that the example is in Wagner and is incorrectly attributed to Armstrong
Also say this about Tversky (1972)
Tversky (1972) gave a similar example involving two vacations, one to Paris and one to Rome, between which someone is indifferent. Adding a complimentary bottle of water to the Paris vacation will produce an option that is preferred to Paris without the water, yet the person remains indifferent between Paris + water and Rome.

In his review, Debreu (1960, 188) did not use dishes as examples but three
recordings of classical music: a recording of the Debussy quarter, a recording of the
eight symphony of Beethoven by a certain conductor, and a recording of the eight
symphony of Beethoven by another conductor. A analogous point – based on a pony,
a bicycle, and another bicycle endowed with a speedometer – was independently
made by Savage in private correspondence with Luce; see Luce and Suppes 1965,
