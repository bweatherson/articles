# Properties of Choice Functions

α: (x ∈ C(S) ∧ x ∈ T ∧ T ⊆ S) → x ∈ C(T)

- If x is chosen from S and T is a subset of S that contains x, then x is also chosen from T.

β: (x ∈ C(T) ∧ y ∈ C(T) ∧ T ⊆ S) → (x ∈ C(S) ↔ y ∈ C(S))

- If x and y are both chosen from T, and T is a subset of S, then x is chosen from S if and only if y is chosen from S.

γ: (x ∈ C(S) ∧ x ∈ C(T)) → (x ∈ C(S ∪ T))

- If x is chosen from both S and T, then x is chosen from the union of S and T.

δ: (x ∈ C(T) ∧ y ∈ C(T) ∧ T ⊆ S) → ({y} ≠ C(S))

- If x and y are both chosen from T, and T is a subset of S, then y is not the only option chosen from S.
