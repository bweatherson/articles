# Section 23: Lotteries, Choices, and Values (lines 480-524)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 486**: "If the numbers in @tbl-secretaries measure importance, then Ms. Jones's preferences should satisfy (a special case of) what Lederman calls **Unidimensional Expectations**."
  - Consider whether "Ms. Jones's" possessive is formatted consistently (could be "Ms. Jones'" without the second s, depending on style guide)

- **Line 490**: ":    *L*⟨*x*, *y*~1~⟩⟨*x*, *y*~2~⟩ = ⟨*x*, (*y*~1~ + y~2~)/2⟩"
  - Missing italics: "y~2~" should be "*y*~2~"
  - Should be: ":    *L*⟨*x*, *y*~1~⟩⟨*x*, *y*~2~⟩ = ⟨*x*, (*y*~1~ + *y*~2~)/2⟩"

- **Line 500**: ":    *L*⟨*x*, *x*⟩⟨*y*, *y*⟩ = ⟨(*x* + *y*)/2,(*x* + *y*)/2"
  - Missing closing angle bracket and ⟩
  - Should be: ":    *L*⟨*x*, *x*⟩⟨*y*, *y*⟩ = ⟨(*x* + *y*)/2, (*x* + *y*)/2⟩"
  - Also missing space after comma

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 482**: "In this section I'll offer a response, on Levi's behalf, to Sen's dilemma."
  - This is clear

- **Line 482**: "The example will draw heavily on recent work by Harvey @Lederman2025."
  - Good to acknowledge the source

- **Line 484**: "I'll write *Lxy* for a lottery that has equal chance of returning outcomes *x* and *y*, where these might be secretaries or further lotteries."
  - This is clear

- **Line 484**: "I'll write *x* = *y* for what I've previously written as *xEy*. It means that *x* and *y* are equally good by Ms. Jones's lights."
  - Clear explanation of notation change

- **Line 484**: "It's perhaps suboptimal to introduce new notation for an old concept, but the mix of L's and E's became hard to read."
  - Good meta-comment acknowledging the notational choice

- **Line 484**: "Finally, I'll write ⟨*x*, *y*⟩ for a secretary with skill *x* at typing and skill *y* at stenography."
  - Clear

- **Line 492**: "That is, the value of a lottery where the possible outcomes agree on one dimension also has the same value on that dimension, and has the expected value of the other dimension."
  - Consider: "That is, if a lottery's possible outcomes agree on one dimension, the lottery also has that same value on that dimension, and has the expected value on the other dimension." (Clearer subject)

- **Line 492**: "If the lottery does not involve value conflict, old fashioned expected value maximisation is the way to go."
  - "old fashioned" should be hyphenated: "old-fashioned"
  - "maximisation" vs "maximization" - ensure consistent spelling

- **Line 494**: "This is enough to rule out the example Sen has in mind on the first horn, where a secretary with skill 1 on either dimension is more than half as valuable as a secretary with skill 10."
  - This is clear

- **Line 494**: "But it's not enough to say that Ms. Jones should not hire Danny."
  - Clear

- **Line 494**: "Unidimensional Expectations is consistent with one resolution of his indeterminate value being that the value of ⟨*x*,*y*⟩ is *xy*."
  - Missing space after comma in ⟨*x*,*y*⟩
  - Consider: "Unidimensional Expectations is consistent with one resolution of his indeterminate value in which the value of ⟨*x*, *y*⟩ is *xy*."

- **Line 508**: "Substitution of Identicals follows naturally from the idea that the outcomes are truly equal, so it doesn't matter whether one has a lottery has an outcome that results in one or the other."
  - Double "has": "whether one has a lottery has"
  - Should be: "...so it doesn't matter whether a lottery has an outcome that results in one or the other."

- **Line 508**: "No Trade-Off, like Unidimensional Expectations, says that when we are just considering strictly better and worse options, so there are no relevant complications about resolving indeterminacy, we're back in the land of expected utility maximisation."
  - Long sentence but clear. Consider breaking after "options": "...strictly better and worse options—so there are no relevant complications about resolving indeterminacy—we're back in the land of expected utility maximisation."

- **Line 508**: "Rearrangement of Outcomes follows from the fact that the compound lotteries on either side of the identity sign each have probability 1/4 of returning one of those four outcomes."
  - This is clear

- **Line 508**: "And Weak Independence, which is probably the most contentious of the lot, says that if *y* is not exactly as good as *x*, then a 1/2 chance of *y* should not be exactly as good as *x*."
  - This is clear

- **Line 522**: "To complete the argument, we need two plausible principles."
  - Good transition

- **Line 522**: "First, *x* is not choiceworthy from *S* when *x* is not choiceworthy from the set consisting of *x* and *Lyz*, for *y*, *z* in *S*."
  - This is clear though somewhat technical

- **Line 522**: "Second, *x* is not choiceworthy from *S* when an option that is strictly better on every dimension is in *S*."
  - This is clear

- **Line 524**: "There are several assumptions here, and any one of them could be the subject of a whole paper."
  - Good acknowledgment of complexity

- **Line 524**: "But they each seem very plausible, and they show how we can ground the intuition that the multi-utility approach is on the right track, and sometimes an option is not choiceworthy because it is close to the worst option on every dimension we care about."
  - Long sentence. Consider breaking: "But they each seem very plausible. They show how we can ground the intuition that the multi-utility approach is on the right track: sometimes an option is not choiceworthy because it is close to the worst option on every dimension we care about."

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Technical complexity**: This is the most technically complex section of the paper, with substantial formal machinery. The exposition is generally clear given the difficulty.

- **Notation**: The introduction of new notation is well-motivated and clearly explained. The meta-comment about L's and E's is helpful.

- **Principles**: The five principles (UE, SI, NT, RO, WI) are clearly stated and explained, with good intuitive glosses.

- **Formal argument**: The numbered proof (lines 512-520) is clearly laid out and easy to follow.

- **Lederman engagement**: Good engagement with Lederman's recent work, which is at the cutting edge of this literature.

- **Errors**: The main issues are the missing closing bracket in line 500, double "has" in line 508, and missing italics in line 490.

- **Purpose**: The section successfully responds to Sen's challenge by showing how formal principles can ground the intuition that Danny is not choiceworthy.

- **Acknowledgment of complexity**: Good to acknowledge that each assumption could merit extended discussion (line 524).

- **Overall**: Despite the technical complexity, this section is well-written and accomplishes its goal of defending Levi's intuition with formal machinery.
