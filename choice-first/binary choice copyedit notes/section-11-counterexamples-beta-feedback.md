# Section 11: Counterexamples to β (lines 241-258)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 250**: "The cases that were more important in the philosophical literature are what @Chang1997 call 'small improvement' cases."
  - Subject-verb disagreement: "@Chang1997" is singular (one author), so should be "calls" not "call"
  - Should be: "...are what @Chang1997 calls 'small improvement' cases."

- **Line 251**: "The earliest case I know of fitting this form is from @LuceRaiffa1957."
  - Grammar is correct

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 241**: The opening sentence with its long footnote works, though the footnote is quite lengthy. Consider whether it could be split or streamlined.

- **Line 247**: "This is said to be a counterexample to II-transitivity because Chooser is indifferent between *x* and *y*, and between *y* and *z*, but strictly prefers *z* to *x*."
  - "This is said to be" is slightly hedging. Consider: "This is a counterexample to II-transitivity because..." (unless you want to maintain distance from this claim)

- **Line 248**: "Chooser would choose either from *x* and *y*, but when *z* is added, *y* is still choiceworthy but *x* is not."
  - "choose either from *x* and *y*" is slightly awkward. Consider: "Chooser would choose either option from {*x*, *y*}..." (using set notation for consistency)

- **Line 249**: "This example was historically important, but it's not discussed that much in the contemporary philosophical literature."
  - "that much" is informal. Consider: "This example was historically important, but it is rarely discussed in contemporary philosophical literature."

- **Line 249**: "It could be because philosophers were convinced by the argument by Delia Graff @Fara2001 that phenomenal indistinguishability is in fact transitive."
  - Remove "by...by": "It could be that philosophers were convinced by Delia Graff @Fara2001's argument that phenomenal indistinguishability is in fact transitive."
  - Or: "Perhaps philosophers were convinced by Delia Graff @Fara2001 that phenomenal indistinguishability is in fact transitive."

- **Line 249**: "But it did get widely discussed in economics, especially once it started being discussed by Luce [-@Luce1956; -@Luce1959], who used similar examples to argue that preferences form a semi-order."
  - "it did get widely discussed...it started being discussed" is repetitive. Consider: "But it was widely discussed in economics, especially after Luce [-@Luce1956; -@Luce1959] used similar examples to argue that preferences form a semiorder."
  - Note: "semi-order" should be "semiorder" for consistency with earlier usage

- **Line 251**: "The earliest case I know of fitting this form is from @LuceRaiffa1957."
  - This is fine, though could be: "The earliest example of this form I know is from @LuceRaiffa1957."

- **Line 255**: "An example with the same structure, involving a boy, a bicycle, and a bell, is discussed by @LehrerWagner1985, and mistakenly attributed to @Armstrong1939."
  - This is clear

- **Line 257**: "The usual way these cases are discussed, starting with Luce and Raiffa, is that they violate a certain kind of comparability."
  - This is clear and effective

- **Line 257**: "I want to resist this reading."
  - Strong and clear positioning

- **Line 257-258**: "The core intuition in small improvement cases is that β fails. Chooser would choose either option from {*a*, *b*}, but if *a*^+^ is added as an option, *a* becomes unchoiceworthy."
  - This is clear and well-stated

- **Line 258**: "If we add the assumption that *R* = *B*(*C*), then it does follow that trichotomy fails, and there is a sense in which they are incomparable."
  - This is clear

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Two types of counterexamples**: The section effectively presents two distinct types of counterexamples to β - the Fechner/indistinguishability cases and the small improvement cases. The structure is clear.

- **Historical context**: Good attention to historical development, from Armstrong through Luce to contemporary discussions.

- **Philosophical positioning**: Your resistance to the "incomparability" reading (line 257) is well-flagged and sets up an important distinction for later.

- **Forward reference**: The reference to @sec-dorr effectively signals that you'll return to this issue.

- **Footnote length**: The opening footnote is quite long but informative. Consider whether all the historical detail needs to be there.

- **Transition**: The section transitions well from presenting the counterexamples to analyzing them and positioning your view against the standard interpretation.

- **Technical precision**: Good use of formal notation and clear connection to β and II-transitivity.

- **Missing**: You might briefly explain why the bicycle/bell example is "mistakenly" attributed to Armstrong—what does Armstrong's actual example involve?
