# Section 15: Degenerate Games (lines 297-334)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 330**: "But in @tbl-allthree, the only choiceworthy options are for Row are Up and Down."
  - **Error**: Double "are" - "options are for Row are"
  - Should be: "But in @tbl-allthree, the only choiceworthy options for Row are Up and Down."

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 299**: "Say a two-player game is **degenerate** iff the payoffs to one of the players are constant in all outcomes of the game."
  - This is clear

- **Line 299**: "For convenience, say Column is the player with a constant outcome."
  - Consider: "For convenience, assume Column is the player with constant payoffs." (More precise - payoffs are constant, not the outcome itself)

- **Line 323**: "Start with the following two assumptions, which seem fairly plausible for games like these."
  - This is clear

- **Line 326**: "A move is choiceworthy only if there is some probability distribution over the other player's moves such that the move maximises expected utility given that distribution."
  - "maximises" vs "maximizes" - ensure consistent spelling (British vs American) throughout

- **Line 328**: "In degenerate games, these necessary and sufficient conditions for choiceworthiness coincide, but in general they are rather different."
  - This is clear

- **Line 330**: After fixing the double "are" error, the sentence is clear

- **Line 330**: "Whatever probability Row assigns to Left/Right, Middle will not maximise expected utility."
  - Consider using "or" instead of slash: "Whatever probability Row assigns to Left or Right, Middle will not maximise expected utility."

- **Line 330**: "So this is a counterexample to γ."
  - Clear and direct

- **Line 332**: "It follows immediately from Lemma 3 in @Pearce1984 that in degenerate games, a choice satisfies those conditions for being choiceworthy iff it is not strictly dominated, where this includes being dominated by mixed strategies."
  - This is a long sentence but clear. The clause "where this includes being dominated by mixed strategies" is an important clarification.

- **Line 332**: "This means that the choices will satisfy Path Independence."
  - Consider: "This means that choices will satisfy Path Independence." (simpler without "the")

- **Line 334**: "Although I'll be arguing against γ, I won't be arguing against Aiz/Path Independence."
  - This is clear

- **Line 334**: "I'm not going to offer anything like a conclusive argument for Aiz, but the pattern suggests that it is the right constraint to add to α to be a fundamental constraint on coherent choiceworthiness."
  - The phrase "to be a fundamental constraint" is slightly redundant. Consider: "...but the pattern suggests that it is the right constraint to add to α as a fundamental constraint on coherent choiceworthiness." or "...but the pattern suggests adding Aiz to α yields the fundamental constraints on coherent choiceworthiness."

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Definition**: The definition of "degenerate" games is clear and well-motivated with the three table examples.

- **Tables**: The three game tables are clear and well-labeled. Good use of progressive complexity (two tables with two options each, then one with three options).

- **Two assumptions**: The two bullet points (lines 325-326) clearly state the criteria for choiceworthiness. These are well-chosen as plausible constraints.

- **Footnote on rationalizability**: The footnote provides helpful context about game-theoretic rationalizability without disrupting the main flow.

- **Analysis**: The analysis of how the games violate γ is clear and well-explained. The progression through the three tables is pedagogically effective.

- **Pearce's result**: Good to cite the specific lemma and explain its application to your argument.

- **Path Independence**: The explanation of why Path Independence holds (line 332) is clear and shows important technical understanding.

- **Pattern observation**: The final paragraph effectively flags a pattern (arguing against γ but not Aiz) that will recur in subsequent sections. This is good meta-commentary.

- **Connection to previous sections**: References to earlier discussions of γ and Aiz are appropriate.

- **Missing**: You might briefly explain why these are called "degenerate" games, though the definition makes it clear enough.
