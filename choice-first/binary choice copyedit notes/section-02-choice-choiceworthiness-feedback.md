# Section 2: Choice and Choiceworthiness (lines 68-79)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 70**: "this has value 17 and that has value 12" - Consider whether these should be italicized for consistency with formal notation elsewhere
- No other typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- **Line 70**: "this has value 17 and that has value 12" and "this is preferable to that" - The pronouns "this" and "that" are used as examples, so they're acceptable here
- **Line 72**: "Some of this literature" - "this" clearly refers to the tradition in economics mentioned in the previous sentence

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 70-71**: "Choice gets less attention in philosophical decision theory than one might expect. The focus is usually on either value (e.g., this has value 17 and that has value 12) or preference (e.g., this is preferable to that)."
  - These two sentences work well. No change needed.

- **Line 71**: "Norms on choice are almost an afterthought in standard presentations."
  - Consider: "Standard presentations treat norms on choice as almost an afterthought." (More active voice)

- **Line 72**: "There is a long tradition in economics, going back to Paul @Samuelson1938 and Herman @Chernoff1954, of taking choice to be primary."
  - Consider removing "going back to" for conciseness: "There is a long tradition in economics, starting with Paul @Samuelson1938 and Herman @Chernoff1954, of taking choice to be primary."

- **Line 72-73**: "Some of this literature rested on largely behaviourist or positivist assumptions. It was better to theorise with and about choice because it was observable, unlike preferences or values."
  - These could be combined: "Some of this literature rested on largely behaviourist or positivist assumptions: it was better to theorise with and about choice because, unlike preferences or values, it was observable."

- **Line 76**: "Much of the formal work on choice theory has been done by theorists from the behaviourist side, and I'll be inevitably drawing from their work."
  - Consider: "Much of the formal work on choice theory has been done by behaviourist theorists, and I'll inevitably draw from their work." (Simpler phrasing, remove "be")

- **Line 78**: "The real assumption is that the mental state being ascribed in choiceworthiness ascriptions is the same kind of state as that being ascribed in preference ascriptions."
  - This sentence has "ascribed/ascriptions/ascriptions" three times. Consider: "The key assumption is that choiceworthiness ascriptions involve the same kind of mental state as preference ascriptions." (More concise and less repetitive)

- **Line 78-79**: "The biggest difference between choice and preference is that choiceworthiness is a relation to an arbitrarily sized set of options, while preference is a relation to a pair of options."
  - Consider: "The biggest difference is that choiceworthiness relates to sets of any size, while preference relates to pairs." (More concise)

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Opening strategy**: The opening effectively contrasts the lack of attention to choice with the focus on value and preference. This sets up your distinctive approach well.

- **Historical context**: The transition from economics tradition to your approach is clear, but you might consider being more explicit about why you're rejecting the behaviourist approach beyond just saying "That's not going to be my approach here." What's the philosophical problem with it?

- **Mentalism clarification**: The discussion of your mentalist approach (line 76) is good, but the phrase "I'm taking a mentalist approach not a behaviourist approach" might benefit from a brief clause about what this means in practice.

- **Metaphysical neutrality**: The paragraph about not taking a stance on the metaphysics (lines 78-79) is helpful, but it comes somewhat abruptly. Consider adding a transition sentence to signal why this clarification matters at this point.

- **Connection to previous section**: You might add a sentence at the end connecting back to the binary choice theme from the introduction, since that's your overarching concern.

- **Sen introduction**: The final sentence mentions you'll draw on Sen, which is good, but readers don't yet know what aspects of Sen's work will be relevant. Consider briefly flagging that Sen's work on choice functions will be central.
