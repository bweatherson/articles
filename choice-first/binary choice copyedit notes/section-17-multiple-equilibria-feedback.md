# Section 17: Multiple Equilibria (lines 344-369)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- No typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 346**: "This is a decision theory paper, so we need to introduce a demon who can reliably predict Chooser's choices."
  - Nice touch of humor! This is clear.

- **Line 346**: "We'll start with a version of what @Skyrms1982 calls 'Nice Demon'; we'll just call them Demon."
  - This is clear

- **Line 346**: "In @tbl-nice-demon, Chooser selects Up or Down, and Demon either predicts Up (PU), or predicts Down (PD)."
  - Consider removing the comma before "or predicts": "...and Demon either predicts Up (PU) or predicts Down (PD)."

- **Line 355**: "Jack @Spencer2023 argues against views, like the one defended by Dmitri @Gallow2020, which say only Up is choiceworthy in @tbl-nice-demon."
  - This is clear

- **Line 355**: "Spencer's argument relies on a simple principle. If Chooser plans to play Down, then Chooser knows Down will have the best return, and it's not irrational to make a choice if one knows, when one makes it, that the choice will have the best return."
  - This is clear and well-explained

- **Line 355**: "@Gallow2024 replies that in some cases, especially those involving high stakes, it isn't always rational to do what one knows will produce the best return."
  - This is clear

- **Line 355**: "Since I think it's a fundamental feature of knowledge that it does rationalise action in the way Spencer suggests (@WeathersonKAHIS), I think Spencer has the better of this exchange."
  - "rationalise" vs "rationalize" - ensure consistent spelling throughout
  - "has the better of this exchange" is idiomatic and clear

- **Line 355**: "So I'll follow him and assume that both options are choiceworthy in games like @tbl-nice-demon where multiple options are self-verifying."
  - This is clear

- **Line 355**: The footnote about Lewis's causal decision theory is helpful and appropriately detailed.

- **Line 357**: "Now add a third option, Exit, which has a guaranteed return of 1."
  - Clear transition to the extended example

- **Line 367**: "In @tbl-nice-demon-exit, Exit is not choiceworthy."
  - Clear statement

- **Line 367**: "Whatever credences Chooser has about what Demon has done, it is better in expectation to choose one of Up or Down."
  - This is clear

- **Line 367**: "But if either Up or Down were unavailable, Exit would be a permissible choice, given the earlier assumption that any self-verifying choice in cases like @tbl-nice-demon is choiceworthy."
  - This is a long sentence but clear. Could potentially break after "choice": "But if either Up or Down were unavailable, Exit would be a permissible choice. This follows from the earlier assumption that any self-verifying choice in cases like @tbl-nice-demon is choiceworthy."

- **Line 367**: "So like in @sec-games and @sec-uncertainty, we have a counterexample to γ."
  - Clear connection to previous examples

- **Line 369**: "There is an important general lesson from this case. What makes an option choiceworthy in cases like this is that it is utility maximising _once it is chosen_."
  - This is an important insight, well-stated
  - "maximising" vs "maximizing" - ensure consistent spelling

- **Line 369**: "We'll turn next to a more dramatic illustration of this point."
  - Good transition to next section

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Setup**: The introduction of the Demon is engaging and the setup is clear.

- **Philosophical engagement**: Good engagement with the Spencer-Gallow debate. You stake out a clear position while acknowledging the controversy.

- **Self-verification**: The concept of "self-verifying" options is clearly explained through example and argument.

- **Progressive complexity**: The structure (first the 2-option game, then the 3-option game) mirrors the structure of Section 15, which helps readers follow the pattern.

- **Counterexample to γ**: The violation of γ is clearly demonstrated with the Exit option.

- **Key insight**: The final paragraph's insight about ex post utility maximization is crucial and well-positioned as a general lesson.

- **Forward momentum**: Good transition to the next section, signaling that an even more dramatic example is coming.

- **Footnotes**: Both footnotes add valuable context without disrupting the main argument.

- **Connection to broader argument**: This section effectively builds on the pattern established in previous sections while introducing the important ex ante/ex post distinction that will be developed further.

- **Lewis reference**: The footnote about Lewis connects your view to an important alternative in the literature, showing scholarly awareness.
