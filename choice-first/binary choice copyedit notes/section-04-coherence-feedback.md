# Section 4: Coherence (lines 96-104)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 98**: "There is one other striking thing about the picture we get in @vNM1944yaml, and which is still I think broadly endorsed"
  - Grammatical issue: "and which is still I think broadly endorsed" - the placement of "I think" is awkward. Should be: "and which I think is still broadly endorsed"
- No other typos detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- **Line 100**: "these are part of a separate subject to decision theory"
  - "these" refers to "non-coherence constraints" - clear from context

- **Line 102**: "That person either violates no norms, or violates a different kind of norm to the norms of decision theory."
  - "That person" clearly refers to the person who prefers world destruction to finger scratching

- **Line 104**: "whether their choiceworthiness judgments should satisfy conditions"
  - "their" - unclear antecedent. Who does "their" refer to? Presumably Chooser's or agents' choiceworthiness judgments. Consider: "whether choiceworthiness judgments should satisfy..." or "whether Chooser's choiceworthiness judgments should satisfy..."

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 98**: "There is one other striking thing about the picture we get in @vNM1944yaml, and which is still I think broadly endorsed by contemporary decision theorists."
  - As noted above, fix to: "...and which I think is still broadly endorsed..."
  - Alternative: "There is one other striking thing about the picture we get in @vNM1944yaml, which I think is still broadly endorsed by contemporary decision theorists." (Remove "and")

- **Line 98**: "The aim is to put norms on preference, and hence on values and choices."
  - Consider: "The aim is to establish norms on preference, and thereby on values and choices." (More formal/precise)

- **Line 98-99**: "It is strange to talk about grounding the normative facts about preference when other preferences play such a crucial role."
  - This could be clearer. Consider: "It seems circular to ground normative facts about preference in other preferences." or "Grounding norms about preference in other preferences appears problematic."

- **Line 99**: "It looks like the grounding relation will be at least cyclic, and possibly intransitive."
  - "It looks like" is slightly informal. Consider: "This suggests the grounding relation is at least cyclic, and possibly intransitive."

- **Line 100**: "If there's a puzzle about this apparent circularity, there are two (related) ways out."
  - Consider removing "If": "This apparent circularity admits two related solutions." or "There are two (related) responses to this circularity."

- **Line 100**: "Another is to say that while there might be some non-coherence constraints on preference, e.g., it is in fact wrong to prefer the world's destruction to one's finger getting scratched, these are part of a separate subject to decision theory."
  - This is a long sentence. Consider breaking it: "Another response allows for non-coherence constraints on preference—for example, it may be wrong to prefer the world's destruction to one's finger getting scratched—but treats these as part of a separate subject from decision theory."

- **Line 102**: "I don't particularly agree with this picture, but I'm going to accept half of it for the purposes of this paper."
  - "don't particularly agree" is weak phrasing. Consider: "I don't fully endorse this picture, but I'll accept half of it for present purposes." or simply "I'll accept half of this picture for present purposes."

- **Line 102**: "That is, I'll assume it's not the role of decision theory to criticise the person who prefers the destruction of the world to the scratching of their finger."
  - "That is" introduces the clarification well, but consider: "Specifically, I'll assume..." (more direct)
  - "criticise" vs "criticize" - use British or American spelling consistently throughout

- **Line 102-103**: "That person either violates no norms, or violates a different kind of norm to the norms of decision theory."
  - "norm to the norms" is awkward. Consider: "That person either violates no norms, or violates a different kind of norm from those of decision theory."

- **Line 104**: "So the big question is not whether preferences should satisfy transitivity or independence, but whether their choiceworthiness judgments should satisfy conditions like those described in @sec-properties."
  - As noted, fix the pronoun issue
  - Consider breaking this up: "So the central question shifts. Instead of asking whether preferences should satisfy transitivity or independence, we should ask whether choiceworthiness judgments should satisfy conditions like those described in @sec-properties."

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Opening connection**: The phrase "one other striking thing" connects to the previous section, though readers might wonder what the first striking thing was (it's implicit in Section 3's argument). Consider: "Another striking feature of the picture..." or be more explicit about the connection.

- **Circularity problem**: The circularity problem (lines 98-99) is important and well-flagged, but you might make it even more vivid. The transitivity example is good, but you could emphasize that we're defining *which* preferences are rational in terms of *other* preferences.

- **Two ways out**: The structure of presenting two related responses (line 100) is clear, though you might signal more explicitly that they both lead to the same place (coherentism about decision theory).

- **Hume reference**: The parenthetical "which perhaps Hume held" is appropriately cautious, but might distract readers unfamiliar with Hume scholarship. Consider whether this adds enough to be worth including, or whether you could add a brief citation to ground this.

- **Vivid example**: The world's destruction vs. finger scratching example is memorable and effective (presumably inspired by Hume's own example). Good choice.

- **Your position**: The paragraph starting at line 102 clearly stakes out your methodological position for the paper. The "half of it" formulation is effective at showing selective acceptance.

- **Forward reference**: The reference to @sec-properties is good forward signaling, but readers don't yet know what those conditions are. Consider a very brief hint: "conditions like those described in @sec-properties (such as α and γ)" or similar.

- **Final sentence**: The final sentence effectively ties the coherence question to your broader metaphysical concern about priority. This is a strong conclusion to the section.

- **Transition**: Consider adding a transitional sentence at the end to lead into the next section, or ensure the next section opens with clear connection to this discussion of coherence.
