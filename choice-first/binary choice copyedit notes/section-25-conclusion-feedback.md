# Section 25: Conclusion (lines 589-602)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 600**: "If all goes well, the values can be measured numerically, and the permissible mixtures are linear mixtures, but as noted in @sec-values, we need some good arguments about why they should be numerical."
  - This is grammatically correct

- **Line 600**: "If they are, the argument in @sec-lotteries should generalise to argue that the permissible mixtures are linear mixtures."
  - "generalise" vs "generalize" - ensure consistent spelling throughout

- No grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 591**: "This paper has been ultimately about the grounding of facts about rational choice."
  - Consider: "This paper has ultimately been about the grounding of facts about rational choice." (More natural word order)

- **Line 591**: "I've been mostly concerned to argue against a popular, if largely implicit, view: rational choice is grounded in rational preference."
  - This is clear

- **Line 591**: "If Chooser wants a holiday, and is choosing where to go, which destinations are rationally choiceworthy is grounded in Chooser's (rational) preferences over pairs of choices."
  - This is clear

- **Line 591**: "I've rejected this primarily for two reasons:"
  - Clear transition to summary

- **Line 593**: "As argued in @sec-multieq and @sec-mixed, choiceworthiness is an ex ante concept, and preference is an ex post concept, and hence choiceworthiness is analytically prior to preference, so should not be grounded in preference."
  - This is a long sentence with three "and"s. Consider: "As argued in @sec-multieq and @sec-mixed, choiceworthiness is an ex ante concept while preference is an ex post concept. Hence choiceworthiness is analytically prior to preference and should not be grounded in it."

- **Line 594**: "Any choice function that violates γ cannot be generated from a preference relation, and there are many reasons for endorsing choice functions which violate γ."
  - This is clear

- **Line 596**: "If rational choiceworthiness is not grounded in preferences, what is it grounded in?"
  - Good rhetorical question to transition to alternatives

- **Line 596**: "There are two natural options here."
  - Clear

- **Line 598**: "A subjectivist theory, as flagged in @sec-coherence, says that norms on choiceworthiness are just coherence norms."
  - Clear

- **Line 598**: "In particular, the key norms are α and Aiz."
  - Clear

- **Line 598**: "What makes this choiceworthiness judgment rational just is that it fits well with the other choiceworthiness judgments."
  - This is clear

- **Line 598**: "There are tricky metaphysical questions about just how instances of coherence norms are grounded, and whether it will mean we have to give up widely accepted principles like that grounding is acyclic."
  - Long sentence but clear

- **Line 598**: "But these questions aren't different in kind to ones that we'd face on the more mainstream view that decision theory is largely about preferences, and norms on preference are coherence norms."
  - Consider: "But these questions aren't different in kind from ones that we'd face..." ("from" instead of "to")

- **Line 600**: "A more objectivist view is also possible, and I'll end by just stating it."
  - Clear transition

- **Line 600**: "The world is full of values, many of them."
  - This is clear, though "many of them" is slightly redundant. Consider: "The world is full of values."

- **Line 600**: "All of these values are orderings (or perhaps semi-orderings) of outcomes."
  - Consider "semi-orderings" vs "semiorderings" for consistency with earlier usage

- **Line 600**: "An option is rationally choiceworthy iff it does best, given Chooser's evidence, on some permissible mixture of some of these values."
  - This is clear

- **Line 602**: "I'm going to leave arguments about which of these views is correct, or which positions between them might be preferable."
  - Missing verb: "leave" needs an object or completion
  - Consider: "I'm going to leave for another occasion arguments about which of these views is correct..." or "I'm going to leave open the question of which of these views is correct..."

- **Line 602**: "All I hoped to do in this final section is to sketch ways in which the core thesis of the paper, that the rationality of choices is prior to the rationality of preferences, could be true."
  - Consider: "All I hoped to do in this final section is sketch ways..." (remove "to" for parallel structure with "is to sketch")
  - Or: "All I have hoped to do in this final section is to sketch ways..." (present perfect tense)

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Summary of argument**: The conclusion effectively summarizes the two main lines of argument against grounding choice in preference.

- **Two alternatives**: The presentation of subjectivist vs objectivist alternatives is clear and appropriately brief for a conclusion.

- **Modesty**: Appropriate modesty in not arguing for which view is correct, instead focusing on showing that your core thesis is compatible with multiple metaethical frameworks.

- **α and Aiz**: Good to highlight these as the key constraints, bringing the discussion full circle.

- **Metaphysical awareness**: Good to acknowledge the metaphysical puzzles (like acyclicity of grounding) without trying to solve them here.

- **Objectivist view**: The objectivist view is clearly stated, though it's given less development than the subjectivist view.

- **Core thesis**: The statement of the core thesis (rationality of choices is prior to rationality of preferences) is clear and memorable.

- **Minor issues**: Main problems are the incomplete sentence in line 602 ("I'm going to leave arguments...") and "different in kind to" which should be "from."

- **Overall assessment**: This is a solid conclusion that summarizes the main argument and gestures toward two different ways of grounding the view. It appropriately doesn't try to do too much, focusing on reiterating the core thesis.

- **Ending**: The paper ends clearly, having accomplished what it set out to do.
