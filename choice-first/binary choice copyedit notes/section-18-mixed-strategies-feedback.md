  - Ensure consistent spelling (British "maximise" vs American "maximize") throughout paper

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 373**: "Demon has stopped being nice, and now wants to play Rock-Paper-Scissors with Chooser."
  - Engaging opening! Clear and vivid.

- **Line 373**: "Given Demon's powers, this could go badly for Chooser."
  - Good understatement for effect

- **Line 373**: "Happily, Chooser can choose to randomise^[...], and all Demon can predict is the probability that Chooser's random process will come up with any option."
  - This is clear. The footnote provides helpful context.

- **Line 373**: "So the best thing for Chooser to do is to pick one of the three options at random."
  - Clear

- **Line 373**: "That alone will maximise expected utility conditional on being chosen."
  - This is the key insight, well-stated

- **Line 375**: "Not coincidentally, the only Nash equilibrium of Rock-Paper-Scissors is for each player to randomise."
  - Good connection to game theory

- **Line 375**: "Nash equilibria are arguably the only sensible strategies if one assumes that every other player has Demon-like abilities to detect what one is doing."
  - This is an interesting claim that effectively motivates the focus on Nash equilibria

- **Line 375**: "But it's a long running puzzle in game theory how it can be uniquely rational to randomise."
  - "long running" should be hyphenated: "long-running puzzle"

- **Line 375-376**: "Why can choosing randomly be better than choosing one of the things one is randomising between?"
  - Effective rhetorical question

- **Line 376**: "To turn this rhetorical question into an argument, note that the following three principles are inconsistent."
  - Good transition to formal argument

- **Line 377-379**: The three principles are clearly stated and labeled

- **Line 381**: "Since (@rps) is a standard view in game theory, (@ctop) is a standard view in choice theory, and (@notm) is a standard view in preference-based decision theory, it is a little disconcerting to see they are inconsistent."
  - Excellent framing of the puzzle. The understated "a little disconcerting" is effective.

- **Line 383**: "The example in @sec-multieq shows how to steer through this trilemma."
  - Clear connection back to previous section

- **Line 383**: "Choiceworthiness is fundamentally an ex ante notion, and preference is fundamentally an ex post notion."
  - This is the key theoretical claim, stated clearly and forcefully

- **Line 383-384**: "The reason Spencer's view about @tbl-nice-demon is right is not that the rational chooser is indifferent between Up and Down. Rather, choosers don't have preferences between these choices until they have chosen, and once they choose, they prefer their choice."
  - This is clear and importantly distinguishes your view from a standard indifference interpretation

- **Line 385**: "Similarly in Rock-Paper-Scissors (especially against a Demon), what's true is that prior to deciding, the only rational choice is to randomise."
  - Clear parallel to the previous case

- **Line 385**: "Before the choice, there is no such thing as Chooser's preferences over the options; what I earlier called definedness fails."
  - Good callback to earlier terminology

- **Line 385-386**: "Once one has chosen, one should be strictly indifferent between the options; they each have the same expected utility."
  - Wait - should this be "strictly indifferent"? That seems contradictory. Perhaps just "indifferent"? Or do you mean something technical by "strictly indifferent"?

- **Line 386**: "In particular, one should not prefer to re-randomise rather than put into effect the result of the random process."
  - Important clarification

- **Line 387**: "So we should reject (@ctop) in its most natural interpretation."
  - Clear conclusion

- **Line 389**: "Most of the arguments in this paper against the binariness of choice turn on counterexamples to γ, but this is a distinct argument."
  - Good meta-commentary

- **Line 389**: "Sometimes, as in Rock-Paper-Scissors, there are grounds for rational choice, but no grounds for rational preference."
  - This is the key insight, clearly stated

- **Line 391**: "This is the deepest reason why *C* = *B*(*R*) must be wrong; *C* and *R* are fundamentally about different kinds of attitudes."
  - Strong claim, well-positioned

- **Line 391**: "*C* is about what is rational prior to making a choice, *R* is a constraint that must be satisfied once a choice is made."
  - Clear and important distinction

- **Line 391**: "Outside of Newcomb-like cases, this distinction won't often matter, but it is another reason that the equation fails."
  - Good to acknowledge the scope/limits of the argument

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Puzzle presentation**: The section does an excellent job of presenting a genuine puzzle in game theory (the rationality of randomization) in a clear and engaging way.

- **Three principles**: The formulation of the inconsistent triad (@rps, @ctop, @notm) is clear and effective.

- **Solution**: Your solution—rejecting (@ctop) by distinguishing ex ante choiceworthiness from ex post preference—is clearly articulated.

- **Ex ante/ex post distinction**: This is perhaps the most important theoretical contribution of the paper, and it's well-developed here.

- **Connection to previous sections**: Good connections back to the Nice Demon case and forward-looking claims about the broader argument.

- **Depth claim**: The claim that this is the "deepest reason" (line 391) for rejecting the binary view is bold and well-supported by the argument.

- **Scope acknowledgment**: Good to note that this distinction matters mainly in Newcomb-like cases (line 391).

- **Possible issue**: The phrase "strictly indifferent" (line 385) seems potentially contradictory—check if this is standard terminology or if you mean just "indifferent."

- **Overall assessment**: This is a strong section that presents both a technical puzzle and a philosophical solution. The writing is clear and the argument is well-structured.
