# Section 22: Levi and Sen (lines 458-478)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- No typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 460**: "In _Hard Choices_, Isaac @Levi1986 defended a view where the choiceworthy options are only those that maximise value on some resolution of the incompleteness in the agent's values."
  - "maximise" vs "maximize" - ensure consistent spelling throughout

- **Line 460**: "He doesn't use this language, but so far this is similar to the multi-utility approach discussed in @sec-aiz."
  - This is clear

- **Line 460**: "Levi also had views about what further constraints there should be on choice, so he did not defend the view I've been discussing where any option that is maximal on any resolution is choiceworthy."
  - This is a long sentence. Consider breaking it: "Levi also had views about what further constraints there should be on choice. Thus, he did not defend the view I've been discussing, where any option that is maximal on any resolution is choiceworthy."

- **Line 462**: "A central example which he uses, and which @Sen2004 picks up on, involves an executive looking to hire a secretary."
  - Consider: "A central example he uses, which @Sen2004 picks up on, involves..." (removing first "which")

- **Line 462**: "I'll follow Sen and call the executive Ms. Jones."
  - Clear

- **Line 462**: "She is looking for a secretary with good typing skills and good stenography skills. (This is the 1980s.)"
  - The parenthetical is helpful context

- **Line 462**: "We'll conceive of these skills, a bit arbitrarily, as distinct values."
  - This is clear

- **Line 472**: "Levi argues that if the numbers are like this, and Danny is barely better than the worse of the other two on each metric, he is not choiceworthy."
  - "worse" should be "worst"
  - Should be: "...and Danny is barely better than the worst of the other two on each metric..."

- **Line 472**: "That's true even though he might be choiceworthy if one or the other candidates was unavailable."
  - Consider: "...if one or the other candidate were unavailable." (subjunctive mood)

- **Line 474**: "Sen argues that the right choice theory in this case should be 'inarticulate', and say that any of the three is choiceworthy."
  - This is clear

- **Line 476**: "On the first horn, we understand these numbers as representing something an objective measure of the skills of the candidates at each of the tasks."
  - Awkward phrasing: "representing something an objective measure"
  - Should be: "On the first horn, we understand these numbers as representing an objective measure of the skills of the candidates at each of the tasks." (remove "something")

- **Line 476**: "As Sen points out, it's easy to imagine situations where someone who is not abysmal at either half of the job is more useful than someone who is an expert on one, and abysmal on the other."
  - This is clear

- **Line 478**: "On the other horn, we measure the 'importance' [@Sen2004 53] of each skill for the task at hand."
  - This is clear

- **Line 478**: "Sen argues, by analogy with the difficulty in establishing a social welfare function out of the welfare of each individual, that there will be no way to do this."
  - This is clear

- **Line 478**: "Let's turn to how we might go about it."
  - Good transition to the next section

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Historical grounding**: Good to introduce Levi's important work and Sen's response, situating your argument in the literature.

- **Ms. Jones example**: The example is clear and well-presented. The table is effective.

- **Sen's dilemma**: The two horns of Sen's dilemma are clearly presented, setting up the challenge you'll respond to.

- **Levi's position**: You effectively explain Levi's view while noting how it differs from your own.

- **Footnote**: The footnote about changing names is appropriate.

- **1980s context**: Good to note the historical context of typing/stenography as relevant skills.

- **Connection to multi-utility**: The connection to the multi-utility approach from @sec-aiz helps readers see how the pieces fit together.

- **Forward momentum**: The final sentence effectively sets up the next section where you'll respond to Sen's challenge.

- **Minor errors**: "worse" should be "worst" is the main error; "representing something an" needs fixing.

- **Overall**: This section effectively sets up the debate between Levi and Sen, preparing the ground for your own response in the next sections.
