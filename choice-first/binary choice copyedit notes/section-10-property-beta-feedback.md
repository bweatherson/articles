# Section 10: Property β (lines 229-240)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 240**: Extra space at end of line (line ends with "to β. " with space after period)
  - Minor formatting issue

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 231**: "If we start with choice functions, the definition of *E* in (@EtoR) is too simple."
  - This is clear and provides good motivation for the new definition

- **Line 235**: "That is, *x* and *y* are equal iff one is never chosen when the other is not."
  - This is clear and concise

- **Line 235**: The footnote about α is helpful. Consider whether "we won't worry about that" is appropriately informal for this context—it works fine conversationally but you might prefer "but we need not address this here" or similar.

- **Line 235-236**: "Given this notion of equality, there is an intuitive gloss on β: Two options are both choiceworthy iff they are equal."
  - This is clear and helpful

- **Line 237**: "If choice functions are grounded in numerical values, then β holds almost automatically."
  - "almost automatically" is slightly informal. Consider: "If choice functions are grounded in numerical values, then β holds as an immediate consequence." or "...then β follows naturally."

- **Line 237**: "Assume there is some function *v* from options to numbers, and *o* is choiceworthy iff *v*(*o*) is maximal."
  - This is clear

- **Line 237-238**: "Then if *x* and *y* are both choiceworthy, they must have the same value, so in any set they will either both be choiceworthy (if no alternative is more valuable), or neither will be (if some alternative is more valuable)."
  - This is a long sentence but clear. Could potentially break after "value": "Then if *x* and *y* are both choiceworthy, they must have the same value. In any set, they will either both be choiceworthy (if no alternative is more valuable) or neither will be (if some alternative is more valuable)."

- **Line 239**: "More generally, given the assumptions from @sec-assumptions, *C* satisfies β iff *B*(*C*) is trichotomous, which is equivalent to *B*(*C*) satisfying II-transitivity."
  - This packs a lot in. Consider whether it would be clearer as two sentences: "More generally, given the assumptions from @sec-assumptions, *C* satisfies β iff *B*(*C*) is trichotomous. This is equivalent to *B*(*C*) satisfying II-transitivity."

- **Line 239-240**: "Unsurprisingly, the two historically significant cases of intuitive counterexamples to II-transitivity also generate intuitive counterexamples to β."
  - This is a good transitional sentence, clearly signaling what's coming next

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Opening motivation**: The section opens by explaining why a new definition of equality is needed when starting from choice functions rather than preference relations. This is pedagogically sound.

- **Technical development**: The progression from (@EtoR) to (@EtoC) is well-motivated and clearly explained.

- **Intuitive gloss**: The intuitive gloss on β (line 235-236) is very helpful. Making the connection between binariness and equality explicit aids understanding.

- **Numerical values argument**: The paragraph about numerical values (lines 237-238) provides good intuition for why β is natural on certain views. This connects back to the discussion of values in Section 3.

- **Equivalence results**: The equivalence between β, trichotomy, and II-transitivity (line 239) is important. You might consider whether this deserves more development or whether you'll return to it later.

- **Forward signaling**: The final sentence effectively sets up the next section, which presumably will discuss these counterexamples.

- **Connection to previous material**: Good connections to (@EtoR) from Section 5 and to @sec-assumptions.

- **Brevity**: This is a relatively short section, which is appropriate since it's primarily setting up the formal machinery needed to understand β and previewing the counterexamples to come.

- **Missing**: You might consider adding a sentence about why these equivalences hold (or citing Sen's proof), though this may be something readers can work out themselves given the definitions.

- **Footnotes**: Both footnotes (lines 235 and 236) are concise and add helpful clarifications without interrupting flow.
