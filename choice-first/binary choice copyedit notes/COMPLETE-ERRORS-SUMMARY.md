## Consistency Issues (British vs American Spelling)

Throughout the paper, ensure consistency in:
- "maximise/maximize"
- "rationalise/rationalize" 
- "behaviour/behavior"
- "favour/favor"
- "travelling/traveling"
- "randomise/randomize"
- "generalise/generalize"
- "criticise/criticize"

Current usage appears mixed. Choose one standard (British or American) and apply consistently.

## Hyphenation Issues
- "semi-order" vs "semiorder" - be consistent (line 201 uses "semiorder", line 221 uses "semi-order")
- "three way" → "three-way"
