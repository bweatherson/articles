# Section 3: Values First? (lines 80-94)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 86**: "17 _utils_" - The underscore italics work, but ensure this renders correctly in all output formats
- **Line 90**: "quintuples of rational numbers" - Correct spelling and grammar
- No typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- **Line 82**: "So we get theorists discussing Newcomb's Problem largely by offering theories about the value of uncertain outcomes (like taking both boxes) in terms of the values and probabilities of those outcomes."
  - "those outcomes" clearly refers back to "uncertain outcomes"

- **Line 88**: "Because all the values are doing is reflecting Chooser's preferences"
  - "the values" is clear in context

- **Line 92**: "How valuable something is just seems like it should be a notion that reflects the value of alternatives to it."
  - "it" refers to "something" - this is acceptable but could be clearer

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 82-83**: "One should prefer the more valuable. So we get theorists discussing Newcomb's Problem largely by offering theories about the value of uncertain outcomes (like taking both boxes) in terms of the values and probabilities of those outcomes."
  - The phrase "So we get theorists discussing" is a bit casual. Consider: "This leads theorists to discuss Newcomb's Problem by..." or "Theorists thus discuss Newcomb's Problem by..."

- **Line 86**: "We'll sometimes say things like this outcome has value 17 _utils_, but this is a placeholder, not a real unit like kilograms or volts."
  - Consider: "We sometimes say an outcome has value 17 _utils_, but 'util' is a placeholder, not a real unit like kilograms or volts." (More direct)

- **Line 87-88**: "The orthodox view is that these values are only defined up to a positive affine transformation. If it's appropriate to represent Chooser with value function *v*, it's appropriate to represent them with any value function *f* where *f*(*o*) = *av*(*o*) + *b*, for positive *a*."
  - The shift from "Chooser" (singular) to "them" (plural) is slightly awkward. Consider: "...it's appropriate to represent Chooser with any value function *f*..." (keeping it singular)

- **Line 88-89**: "Why is this transformation allowed? Because all the values are doing is reflecting Chooser's preferences over outcomes and lotteries, and this transformation doesn't change those preferences."
  - Consider combining with previous sentence or being more explicit: "This transformation is allowed because values merely reflect Chooser's preferences over outcomes and lotteries, which the transformation preserves."

- **Line 90**: "Indeed, the thought that they should be numbers starts causing problems when we get to various puzzles about infinite goods."
  - "starts causing" is slightly awkward. Consider: "Indeed, treating values as numbers creates problems in cases involving infinite goods."

- **Line 90**: Footnote reference placement - "infinite goods.^[See, e.g.," - Standard format

- **Line 92**: "Finally, there is something very strange about the idea of values that are not in any way comparative."
  - This is clear, but "very strange" is somewhat informal for an academic paper. Consider: "Finally, the idea of non-comparative values is problematic." or "deeply puzzling"

- **Line 92**: "How valuable something is just seems like it should be a notion that reflects the value of alternatives to it."
  - Remove "just": "How valuable something is seems like it should be a notion that reflects the value of alternatives." 
  - Or rephrase: "Value appears to be inherently comparative, reflecting how options compare to their alternatives."

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Section purpose**: The opening two sentences effectively set up that you're examining whether values could ground other attitudes. The "first glance/second glance" structure works well.

- **Four reasons structure**: You announce "at least four reasons" and then deliver them clearly with "First," "Second" (implied by "This is related to..."), "Third," and "Finally." However, the second reason is not explicitly labeled. Consider adding "Second," before "The orthodox view..." (line 87) for parallel structure.

- **Technical detail**: The discussion of affine transformations (lines 87-89) is appropriately technical but might benefit from a brief intuitive gloss for readers less familiar with the formalism.

- **Connection between reasons**: The phrase "This is related to the second reason" (line 86) effectively links the first two points, but you might be more explicit about how: units and transformations are related because if values had real units, arbitrary affine transformations wouldn't be permissible.

- **Transition to conclusion**: The final paragraph (lines 93-94) effectively summarizes and previews the controversy to come, but you might add a transition word: "However, the argument of this section..." or "Nevertheless, the argument..."

- **Forward reference**: You mention representation theorems from Ramsey and von Neumann-Morgenstern. It might help to flag whether you'll return to these later, as they seem important to your overall argument.

- **Clarity of conclusion**: Line 94 says preferences "can't do the job" - but which job exactly? Make explicit: "can't do the job of grounding choiceworthiness" or similar.
