# Section 7: Property α (lines 175-186)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- No typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 177**: "This is the most commonly used constraint on choice functions, and it does seem intuitive."
  - Consider removing "does": "This is the most commonly used constraint on choice functions, and it seems intuitive."

- **Line 179**: "If the only two options are tea with a particular friend or staying home, Chooser will take tea."
  - Consider: "If the only two options are having tea with a particular friend or staying home, Chooser will choose tea." (More parallel structure with "having tea" vs just "tea")

- **Line 179**: "But if the option of cocaine with that friend is added, Chooser will stay home."
  - Consider: "But if the option of taking cocaine with that friend is added, Chooser will stay home." (Parallel with "having tea")

- **Line 181**: "So imagine Chooser prefers more cake to less, but does not want to take the last slice."
  - This is clear and concise

- **Line 181**: "If the available options are zero slices or one slice of cake, Chooser will take zero."
  - Consider: "If the available options are zero slices or one slice of cake, Chooser will choose zero." (Consistent with "take" vs "choose")

- **Line 183**: "This is a trickier case, and the natural thing to say is that Chooser doesn't really have the same options in the two cases."
  - Consider removing "really": "...the natural thing to say is that Chooser doesn't have the same options in the two cases." (Stronger without the hedge)

- **Line 183-184**: "It doesn't clearly make sense to ask Chooser to pick between *taking one slice, which is the last*, and *taking three slices when five are available*."
  - This is clear as is

- **Line 185**: "Still, I'm going to set those issues aside and assume, like most theorists do, that α is a constraint on coherent choice functions, and that choice functions are defined over arbitrary sets of options."
  - Consider: "Still, I'll set those issues aside and assume, following most theorists, that α constrains coherent choice functions and that choice functions are defined over arbitrary sets of options." (More concise)

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Opening**: The opening effectively establishes α as the most important constraint and flags that counterexamples exist.

- **Two counterexamples**: The structure of presenting two distinct types of counterexamples (informational and value-dependent) is very clear. The distinction between them is well-drawn.

- **Tea/cocaine example**: This is a vivid and memorable example. The footnote provides additional depth without cluttering the main text.

- **Cake example**: Also vivid and effective. The example clearly illustrates the problem.

- **Response to counterexamples**: Your responses to each counterexample are clear. For the first, you accept the response that *C* changes. For the second, you acknowledge costs but accept the standard move.

- **Methodological clarity**: The final paragraph clearly states your methodological stance, which is important for what follows.

- **Connection to previous section**: The section flows naturally from the previous one, which introduced α formally. Here you explore it in detail.

- **Connection to next section**: The final sentence mentions "those issues" which could be slightly more specific. Consider: "Still, I'll set these individuation issues aside..." to be more explicit about what's being set aside.

- **Footnote**: The footnote at line 179 is helpful and provides a nice argument without interrupting the flow.

- **Balance**: Good balance between acknowledging problems with α and explaining why you'll accept it anyway. This shows philosophical awareness without derailing the argument.
