# Section 21: Bad Compromises (lines 436-456)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 440**: "At risk of trivialising the issue, we can imagine that Pierre's options look like this"
  - "trivialising" vs "trivializing" - ensure consistent British/American spelling throughout

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 438**: "My version of the Pierre example was very simple, but it allows for some interesting complications."
  - This is clear

- **Line 438**: "As stated, you might think Pierre isn't thinking through his choices well enough."
  - This is clear

- **Line 438**: "He should join the local resistance, so he can stay close enough to his mother to help, while also fighting the Nazis."
  - This is clear

- **Line 440**: "But maybe that's a terrible option."
  - Good conversational opening

- **Line 440**: "We can easily imagine that the resistance is either so useless that it does practically nothing, or so good at recruiting that it has little useful work."
  - This is clear, though the second disjunct is a bit surprising logically. Consider briefly clarifying why being good at recruiting means little useful work (perhaps: "or so good at recruiting that it's overstaffed and has little useful work for new members")

- **Line 440**: "It's just as easy to imagine that it creates busywork that dramatically reduces how much he can care for his mother, while not doing much to help the war effort."
  - This is clear

- **Line 440**: "At risk of trivialising the issue, we can imagine that Pierre's options look like this, where the two columns represent how much each option respects/promotes the relevant value."
  - Consider using "or" instead of slash: "respects or promotes"

- **Line 450**: "Intuitively, if these are Pierre's options he should not join the resistance; it's almost the worst of both worlds."
  - This is clear and captures the intuition well

- **Line 450**: "We don't want to rest on an intuition, and I'll argue for the view that Pierre should shun the resistance in the next two sections."
  - This is clear

- **Line 450**: "If it is irrational to join the resistance in @tbl-pierreresist, this is another counterexample to γ."
  - Clear statement

- **Line 452**: The "No exit" case is clearly described

- **Line 454**: The "Promise" case is clearly described

- **Line 456**: "In either case, joining the resistance seems choiceworthy."
  - This is clear

- **Line 456**: "In both cases, it is the option that does best of the remaining choices on one of the criteria."
  - Slightly awkward phrasing. Consider: "In both cases, it is the option that performs best among the remaining choices on one of the criteria."

- **Line 456**: "Pierre could decide he endorses that criteria as his own, and acts accordingly."
  - "criteria" should be "criterion" (singular)
  - Should be: "Pierre could decide he endorses that criterion as his own, and acts accordingly."

- **Line 456**: "So the resistance is choiceworthy amongst either pair of options, but not amongst their union."
  - "amongst" vs "among" - ensure consistent usage throughout (though both are correct, "among" is more common in American English)

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Extension of example**: This section effectively extends the Pierre example by adding a third option (resistance), which complicates the picture in interesting ways.

- **Table**: The table (@tbl-pierreresist) clearly shows why the resistance is dominated on both dimensions.

- **Intuition**: The intuition that the resistance is not choiceworthy is well-captured and clearly stated.

- **Two scenarios**: The "No exit" and "Promise" scenarios are well-chosen to show that the resistance becomes choiceworthy in pairwise comparisons.

- **γ violation**: The violation of γ is clearly demonstrated: resistance is choiceworthy in two pairwise comparisons but not in the three-way choice.

- **Forward reference**: Good signaling that arguments will come in the next two sections, which manages reader expectations.

- **Connection to earlier examples**: This parallels the structure of the game-theoretic examples nicely, showing how the same logical structure applies to ethical dilemmas.

- **Minor issues**: The criterion/criteria error and the slightly unclear "good at recruiting" point are the main issues.

- **Overall**: This is a strong section that adds depth to the Pierre case and provides another clear counterexample to γ.
