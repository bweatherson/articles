# Section 16: Choice Under Uncertainty (lines 336-342)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- No typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 338**: "@LuceRaiffa1957 discuss what they call choices under 'uncertainty', by which they mean choices where Chooser cannot assign probabilities to the states."
  - This is clear

- **Line 338**: "Martin @Peterson2017 calls these choices under 'ignorance'."
  - This is clear - good to note the terminological variation

- **Line 338**: "None of the proposed decisive rules for choice under uncertainty/ignorance are particularly compelling; all lead to very strange outcomes."
  - This is a strong claim. Consider whether you want to add "in my view" or similar, though the next paragraph starts with "in my opinion" so perhaps this is implied.

- **Line 340**: "The best approach, in my opinion, is to treat these choices like degenerate games."
  - Clear statement of your view

- **Line 340**: "Indeed, degenerate games are really a paradigm of choice under ignorance; Row has no reason to assign any particular probability to Column's choice."
  - This is an important insight, well-stated

- **Line 340**: "Further, what the game theory textbooks say about degenerate games seems fairly plausible; any undominated option is choiceworthy."
  - Consider whether "seems fairly plausible" is too hedging given you're endorsing this view. Might be stronger: "Further, the game theory textbooks' recommendation about degenerate games is plausible: any undominated option is choiceworthy."

- **Line 340**: "The same goes for choices under ignorance; any undominated option is choiceworthy."
  - Clear parallel structure with previous sentence

- **Line 342**: "If that's right, then the three examples from @sec-games can be repurposed as examples of choice under uncertainty, replacing Left and Right with *p* and ¬*p*, and the same analysis will hold."
  - This is clear, though "uncertainty" here should perhaps be "ignorance" for consistency with your earlier usage (you distinguished these terms)

- **Line 342**: "Again γ will fail, because Middle is choiceworthy when there is one other option, but not when they are two."
  - Small error: "when they are two" should be "when there are two"
  - Should be: "...but not when there are two."

- **Line 342**: "So there's no binary comparison of Middle with the other two options that explains the facts about what is choiceworthy in the three cases."
  - This is clear

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Purpose**: This section effectively extends the degenerate games argument to a broader class of cases (choice under ignorance/uncertainty).

- **Terminology**: Good to note both "uncertainty" and "ignorance" terminology and cite sources for each.

- **Key insight**: The insight that degenerate games are paradigmatic cases of choice under ignorance (line 340) is important and well-stated.

- **Brevity**: This section is appropriately brief since it's essentially applying the same reasoning from the previous section to a different domain.

- **Parsimony**: The approach is appealingly parsimonious - treating both degenerate games and choice under ignorance with the same principle (any undominated option is choiceworthy).

- **Connection**: The explicit connection back to @sec-games is clear and helps readers see the parallel structure.

- **Criticism of alternatives**: The claim that "all" proposed decisive rules lead to "very strange outcomes" (line 338) is strong. You might consider briefly mentioning examples (maximin, maximax, etc.) or citing sources for this claim, though this might disrupt the flow.

- **Missing**: Consider whether you need to address the potential objection that your approach isn't "decisive" either, since it often allows multiple options. Perhaps the point is that decisiveness isn't required?
