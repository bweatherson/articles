# Section 5: Sen on Preference (lines 106-136)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 108**: "The first disjunct obtains if ¬*yRx*, the second disjunct obtains if *yRx*."
  - Consider: "The first disjunct obtains if ¬*yRx*; the second disjunct obtains if *yRx*." (semicolon instead of comma for better separation of independent clauses)

- **Line 125**: "(@PItrans) is what Sen calls PI-transitivity, and (@IItrans) is what he calls II-transitivity."
  - Grammar is correct

- **Line 127**: Footnote reference format is correct

- **Line 133**: "In most of those works it is assumed that *P* is transitive and *xRy* ∨ *yRx*, so (@Tri) and (@IItrans) are equivalent."
  - Consider adding "that" for clarity: "In most of those works it is assumed that *P* is transitive and that *xRy* ∨ *yRx*, so (@Tri) and (@IItrans) are equivalent."

- No other typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context (following your instruction)

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 108**: "The main binary relation Sen uses, which he denotes *R*, is such that *xRy* means that Chooser either prefers *x* to *y*, or is indifferent between *x* and *y*."
  - Consider: "Sen's main binary relation *R* is such that *xRy* means Chooser either prefers *x* to *y* or is indifferent between them." (More concise)

- **Line 108**: "We'll write these two disjuncts as *xPy* and *xIy*. Formally, that is, they can be defined in terms of *R* in (@RtoP) and (@RtoI)."
  - The phrase "Formally, that is," is awkward. Consider: "We'll write these two disjuncts as *xPy* and *xIy*. Formally, they are defined in terms of *R* in (@RtoP) and (@RtoI)."

- **Line 113**: "It is important that indifference not be understood as equality."
  - Consider: "It is important not to conflate indifference with equality." (More direct)

- **Line 113**: "If we take transitivity to be part of the definition of equality, it is misleading to gloss *xRy* as that *x* is greater than **or equal** to *y* (for Chooser)."
  - Remove "that": "...it is misleading to gloss *xRy* as *x* being greater than **or equal** to *y* (for Chooser)."

- **Line 115**: "A more common way of doing things in contemporary philosophy is to start with *P* and a fourth relation *E*, where *xEy* means that *x* and *y* are equally good."
  - Consider: "Contemporary philosophy more commonly starts with *P* and a fourth relation *E*, where *xEy* means that *x* and *y* are equally good." (More direct)

- **Line 115**: "On this picture, both (@RtoP) and (@RtoI) are true, but the explanatory direction in both cases is right-to-left."
  - This is clear and concise

- **Line 115-116**: "On the version Sen uses, it's a little trickier to define *E*, but (@EtoR) looks like a plausible conjecture."
  - "looks like a plausible conjecture" is slightly informal. Consider: "On Sen's version, defining *E* is trickier, but (@EtoR) is a plausible proposal." or simply "but (@EtoR) is plausible."

- **Line 127**: The very long footnote (with embedded proof) might be better split or moved to an appendix, though this is a stylistic choice

- **Line 129**: "What should we call the principle (@Tri)? The terminology around here gets potentially confusing."
  - "around here" is colloquial. Consider: "What should we call the principle (@Tri)? The terminology is potentially confusing."

- **Line 129**: "That's what @Gustafsson2025 calls *completeness*, and I feel that's often what philosophers understand by 'completeness'."
  - "I feel that's" is informal. Consider: "That's what @Gustafsson2025 calls *completeness*, which I believe is the common philosophical understanding." or "...and that's often what philosophers understand by 'completeness'."

- **Line 131**: "But the latter is useful because various interesting possibilities open up both in social choice theory, and in the relationship between preference and choice, if it is dropped."
  - Remove comma before "and": "...open up both in social choice theory and in the relationship between preference and choice, if it is dropped."

- **Line 133**: "While (@Tri) is widely discussed in philosophy, it isn't often discussed as such in the economics literature."
  - "as such" could be clearer. Consider: "While philosophers widely discuss (@Tri), the economics literature discusses it less often under that formulation." or "...less frequently in those terms."

- **Line 135**: "More generally, I find using 'completeness' to denote either *x* ≿ *y* ∨ *y* ≿ *x* or *xRy* ∨ *yRx* potentially confusing, since in either case it is easy to mistakenly believe the author is talking about the other property."
  - Consider: "More generally, using 'completeness' for either *x* ≿ *y* ∨ *y* ≿ *x* or *xRy* ∨ *yRx* is potentially confusing, since readers may not know which property the author intends."

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Technical exposition**: This section does an excellent job of laying out Sen's framework clearly. The step-by-step explanation of *R*, *P*, *I*, and *E* is well-structured.

- **Notation introduction**: The parenthetical "(Throughout, I'm leaving off wide scope universal quantifiers over free variables.)" (line 108) is helpful for readers familiar with formal logic.

- **Bidirectional comparison**: The comparison between Sen's approach and contemporary philosophy's approach (lines 115-116) effectively shows different ways of organizing the same concepts.

- **Equivalence results**: The discussion of equivalences between (@Tri), (@PItrans), and (@IItrans) is clear, though the long footnote with the full proof might interrupt flow for some readers.

- **Terminological clarity**: The discussion of terminology (lines 129-136) is excellent and necessary given the field's inconsistency. Your decision to follow Chang and use "trichotomous" and "definedness" is well-justified.

- **Historical context**: The reference to Armstrong's work (line 133) provides good historical grounding, though you might consider whether all three citations are necessary or if one or two would suffice.

- **Transition to next section**: The section ends somewhat abruptly. Consider adding a brief transitional sentence about how these preference relations connect to choice functions, which is the topic of the next section.

- **Armstrong references**: Line 133 has "Wallace E. Armstrong [-@Armstrong1939; -@Armstrong1948; -@Armstrong1950]" - check if this citation format with the minus signs is intentional/correct for your bibliography style.

- **Length of footnote 127**: The footnote is extremely long with a detailed proof. Consider whether this is the right level of detail for a footnote or if it should be in the main text, an appendix, or simply referenced to Sen's work.
