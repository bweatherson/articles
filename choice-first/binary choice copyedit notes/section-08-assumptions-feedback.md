# Section 8: Assumptions (lines 187-202)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 195**: "i.e., there is a universe of options *U* all subsets of *U* are in the domain of *C*."
  - Missing word. Should be: "i.e., there is a universe of options *U* and all subsets of *U* are in the domain of *C*." OR "i.e., there is a universe of options *U* such that all subsets of *U* are in the domain of *C*."

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 189**: "These aren't intended to stack the deck in my favour; if any of these assumptions are false, their falsity makes the view that choices are not binary (a) more plausible, but (b) harder to state."
  - "favour" vs "favor" - ensure consistent spelling (British vs American) throughout paper
  - The structure "(a)...but (b)" is clear and effective

- **Line 197**: "The universe *U* of options, that *S* is a subset of, and *x* is drawn from, is finite."
  - This is somewhat convoluted. Consider: "The universe *U* of options is finite, where both *S* and *x* are drawn from *U*."
  - Or: "The universe *U* of options (from which *S* and *x* are drawn) is finite."

- **Line 199**: "In @sec-alpha we saw one reason to reject (v), namely that we might want to individuate options in terms of what else is available."
  - This is clear

- **Line 199**: "The cases we'll discuss in @sec-mixed provide another, but rather than explore that, I'll follow standard practice and assume (v) throughout this paper."
  - Consider: "The cases in @sec-mixed provide another reason, but I'll follow standard practice and assume (v) throughout." (Slightly more concise)

- **Line 201**: "When *R* satisfies (i)-(iii), I'll follow @Luce1956 and call it a *semiorder*."
  - This is clear and concise

- **Line 201**: "When it also satisfies trichotomy, i.e., (@Tri), I'll call it a *weak order*."
  - Consider: "When it additionally satisfies trichotomy (i.e., (@Tri)), I'll call it a *weak order*." (Slightly clearer that this is building on the semiorder conditions)

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Purpose of section**: This section effectively consolidates all the assumptions in one place, which is very helpful for readers. The explicit listing is appreciated.

- **Metacomment about assumptions**: The opening metacomment (line 189) is excellent. It shows awareness that assumptions could appear question-begging and preemptively addresses this concern. The point that falsity makes your view "more plausible, but harder to state" is insightful.

- **Numbering system**: The use of Roman numerals (i-vii) is appropriate and distinguishes these assumptions from other numbered elements in the paper.

- **Format consistency**: The formatting of the assumptions (i.e., followed by description) is consistent and clear.

- **Forward and backward references**: Good use of section references. You reference back to @sec-alpha for (v) and forward to @sec-mixed, helping readers understand the motivation for these assumptions.

- **Technical terminology**: The introduction of "semiorder" and "weak order" (line 201-202) is well-placed here, as these are technical terms that readers will need going forward.

- **Luce citation**: Good to cite the origin of the "semiorder" terminology.

- **Completeness**: All seven assumptions are clearly stated. Consider whether it would help to add a very brief gloss for each (especially (iv) and (vii)) for readers less familiar with the formalism, though this may not be necessary given your audience.

- **Transition**: The section ends cleanly with the definitions of semiorder and weak order, setting up technical vocabulary for what follows.

- **Missing**: Consider briefly noting which of these assumptions are most controversial or most likely to be challenged, though the references to @sec-alpha and @sec-mixed partially address this.
