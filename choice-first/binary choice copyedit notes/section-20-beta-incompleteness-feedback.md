# Section 20: β and Incompleteness (lines 405-434)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 417**: "Now it would be very strange if the semantics of comparatives in natural language entailed that some intuitions about three way choice had to be false."
  - "three way" should be hyphenated: "three-way choice"

- **Line 419**: "The following view is coherent, and its coherence shows that Dorr et al's view of comparatives does not entail β."
  - Possessive format: "Dorr et al's" could be "Dorr et al.'s" (with period after "al") depending on style guide

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 407**: "The Pierre case in @sec-sartre is, even without the third intuition, a straightforward counterexample to β."
  - This is clear

- **Line 413**: "If the choices are *x* and *y*, either is acceptable. If the choices are *x*, *y* and *z*, *x* alone is unchoiceworthy. So β fails."
  - Clear and concise demonstration

- **Line 415**: "This is the Small Improvement argument, and it is often thought to be an argument against completeness, i.e., (@Tri)."
  - This is clear

- **Line 415**: "The point of this section is to say why the small improvement argument against (@Tri) might fail, even if the small improvement argument against β works."
  - This is clear, though slightly repetitive. Consider: "The point of this section is to explain why the argument against (@Tri) might fail, even though the argument against β succeeds."

- **Line 417**: "Imagine someone was convinced by the arguments in @DorrEtAl2023 that (@Tri) must be true."
  - Consider: "Imagine someone were convinced..." (subjunctive mood) or keep "was" (indicative)

- **Line 417**: "Their arguments turn on semantic properties of comparatives; since *R* is a comparative, they say it must be trichotomous since all comparatives are trichotomous."
  - Two uses of "since" makes this awkward. Consider: "Their arguments turn on semantic properties of comparatives; they claim that since *R* is a comparative, it must be trichotomous, as all comparatives are."

- **Line 422**: "An option is choiceworthy for Pierre iff no option is *determinately* preferred to it."
  - This is clear

- **Line 425**: "Before he does that there are two possibilities."
  - Missing comma: "Before he does that, there are two possibilities."

- **Line 425**: "One is that his preferences aren't even defined over these options, so asking which option is preferred is like asking whether the number 7 is taller, shorter, or the same height as justice."
  - Nice analogy! This is vivid and clear.

- **Line 425**: "Another is that it is vague what Pierre's preferences are, but any resolution of the vagueness makes (@Tri) true."
  - This is clear

- **Line 427**: "One objection to this view is that it seems to imply that Pierre could rationally choose one option while he prefers, but does not determinately prefer, another."
  - This is clear

- **Line 427**: "But this isn't what the view implies."
  - Clear rebuttal

- **Line 427**: "Once Pierre makes the choice, he must, if he is rational, determine that his preferences match it."
  - This is clear

- **Line 427**: "Preference, as I argued in @sec-mixed, is fundamentally an ex post notion."
  - Good callback to earlier argument

- **Line 432**: "Choice, on this picture, is prior to preference, both analytically and, in this case, causally."
  - This is a strong and clear statement of the key claim

- **Line 434**: "When I say this is coherent, I don't mean to half-heartedly say that it is correct."
  - The double negative "don't...half-heartedly" is slightly awkward. Consider: "When I say this is coherent, I don't mean to suggest half-heartedly that it is correct." or "I don't merely claim coherence; I'm not half-heartedly endorsing correctness."

- **Line 434**: "My preferred view is that Pierre could rationally drift (in Chang's sense) into either option, and if he does, (@Tri) would fail even ex post."
  - This is clear

- **Line 434**: "All I mean to argue here is that the case against β doesn't turn on this view, and one can coherently reject β while endorsing trichotomy."
  - Clear statement of the dialectical point

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Purpose**: This section effectively shows that one can reject β while maintaining (@Tri), which is an important dialectical move.

- **Engagement with Dorr et al.**: Good engagement with a specific argument in the literature. The footnote about "stronger" in logic is appropriately relegated to a note rather than developed in the main text.

- **Five-point view**: The bulleted view (lines 421-425) is clearly laid out and shows that the position is internally coherent.

- **Ex ante/ex post**: Good use of the (@expost) and (@exante) labeled principles to make the distinction clear.

- **Preferred view**: You appropriately distinguish between showing coherence and endorsing correctness (line 434), which is philosophically responsible.

- **Connection to Chang**: Good continued engagement with Chang's work on drifting.

- **Footnote on Carr**: The footnote connecting to Carr's view of credence is a nice parallel that enriches the discussion.

- **Dialectical structure**: The section successfully shows that your arguments against β don't require rejecting trichotomy, which broadens the appeal of your view.

- **Missing**: You might briefly explain why someone would want to maintain trichotomy (beyond Dorr et al.'s semantic arguments), though this might be unnecessary given the context.
