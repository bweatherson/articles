# Section 9: Defining Binariness (lines 203-228)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 207**: "I'll assume that there is a universe *U* of options, and every option and set of options is drawn from it."
  - Consider removing comma before "and": "I'll assume that there is a universe *U* of options and every option and set of options is drawn from it."

- **Line 221**: "Sen calls these functions 'basic binary', but the distinction he's drawing attention to by adding 'basic' doesn't make a difference given *R* is a semi-order and α."
  - Hyphenation inconsistency: "semi-order" here but "semiorder" in line 201. Choose one spelling and use consistently.

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 205**: "With these seven assumptions on board, it's easy to state what it is for a choice function to be binary."
  - This is clear and provides good transition

- **Line 206-207**: "First, we'll define an inversion function *B* (for binary) that maps preference relations to choice functions, and vice-versa."
  - This is clear. The "(for binary)" is helpful mnemonic.

- **Line 207**: "Both of these are sets of ordered pairs, and we'll define the ordered pairs directly."
  - Consider: "Both are sets of ordered pairs, which we'll define directly." (Slightly more concise)

- **Line 213**: "That is, *B*(*R*) is the choice function which for any set *S* selects what Sen calls 'maximal' members, those members to which nothing is strictly preferred."
  - This is clear, though the appositive "those members to which nothing is strictly preferred" could be set off more clearly: "That is, *B*(*R*) is the choice function that, for any set *S*, selects what Sen calls 'maximal' members—those members to which nothing is strictly preferred."

- **Line 213-214**: The footnote provides helpful context about Hansson's terminology. Consider whether all five rules need to be mentioned or just that there are alternatives.

- **Line 219**: "That is, *B*(*C*) is the preference relation which says that in any choices from pair sets, an element is chosen only if it is at least as good as the other member."
  - Slightly awkward phrasing. Consider: "That is, *B*(*C*) is the preference relation stating that in pairwise choices, an element is chosen only if it is at least as good as the other element."

- **Line 219**: "@Sen1970sec [319] calls this the 'base relation' as opposed to a more complicated 'revealed preference relation', and notes that the two are equivalent given α."
  - This is clear and helpful

- **Line 221**: "Sen calls these functions 'basic binary', but the distinction he's drawing attention to by adding 'basic' doesn't make a difference given *R* is a semi-order and α."
  - Consider: "Sen calls these functions 'basic binary', but the distinction marked by 'basic' doesn't matter given that *R* is a semiorder and α holds." (Cleaner phrasing)

- **Line 225**: "That is, if you convert *C* into a preference relation, and back into a choice function, you get the same thing back."
  - Consider removing "That is," since the previous line already provided the formal definition: "Converting *C* into a preference relation and back yields the same function."
  - Or keep it but make more formal: "That is, converting *C* to a preference relation and back yields the original function."

- **Line 227**: "The core claim of this paper is that there are coherent choice functions which are not binary."
  - This is an excellent, clear statement of the main thesis

- **Line 227-228**: "A related claim is that a plausible pair of coherence constraints that you can state using *B* do not in fact hold."
  - "that you can state" is slightly informal. Consider: "A related claim is that a plausible pair of coherence constraints stated using *B* do not in fact hold."

- **Line 228**: "The constraints are that if *C* and *R* are an agent's choice function and preference relation, then *C* = *B*(*R*), and *R* = *B*(*C*)."
  - Consider removing the first comma: "The constraints are that if *C* and *R* are an agent's choice function and preference relation then *C* = *B*(*R*), and *R* = *B*(*C*)." 
  - Or restructure: "The constraints require that *C* = *B*(*R*) and *R* = *B*(*C*)."

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Opening**: Good transitional opening that references the assumptions just established.

- **Purpose**: This section achieves its goal of formally defining what it means for a choice function to be binary. This is central to the paper's argument.

- **Technical clarity**: The formal definitions (@IRtoC), (@ICtoR), and (@Bindef) are clearly presented and well-explained with informal glosses.

- **Pedagogical structure**: The pattern of formal definition followed by informal explanation works well throughout.

- **Sen references**: Appropriate references to Sen's terminology throughout, showing engagement with the literature.

- **Footnotes**: Both footnotes add useful context without cluttering the main argument.

- **Core thesis statement**: Line 227 provides an excellent, clear statement of the paper's main claim. This is well-placed after defining what "binary" means.

- **Two claims**: The distinction between the "core claim" and the "related claim" (lines 227-228) is helpful, though you might consider whether these are distinct enough to merit separate labeling, or whether the second is really just a restatement of the first.

- **Connection to what follows**: The final paragraph sets up the rest of the paper nicely by stating what you'll argue against.

- **Missing**: Consider adding a brief intuitive explanation of why the round-trip (*B*(*B*(*C*))) would fail for non-binary choice functions. This might help readers understand what's at stake.
