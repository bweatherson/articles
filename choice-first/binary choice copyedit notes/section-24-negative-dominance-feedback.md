# Section 24: Negative Dominance (lines 526-587)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 561**: "Given Unidimensional Expectations and No Trade-Off (as discussed in @sec-lotteries), the permissible only balancings are linear mixtures of the values."
  - Word order issue: "permissible only balancings"
  - Should be: "the only permissible balancings are linear mixtures of the values."

- **Line 585**: "The striking is that, like in @sec-dorr, we can say all this while saying all the things which trichotomy was supposed to rule out."
  - Missing word: "The striking" should be "The striking thing" or "Strikingly,"
  - Should be: "The striking thing is that..." or "Strikingly, like in @sec-dorr..."

- No other grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 528**: "Harvey @Lederman2025 notes that the picture I've developed, where Danny is unchoiceworthy, appears to violate a plausible principle which he calls **Negative Dominance**."
  - This is clear

- **Line 533**: "The main application of this is to reject the idea that *L*(Jack)(Luke) is better than Danny."
  - This is clear

- **Line 535**: "I said the picture from previous sections 'appears to violate' Negative Dominance because one more assumption is needed to generate the tension."
  - Good clarification

- **Line 535**: "The assumption is that when Chooser has only two options, preference and choiceworthiness are closely related."
  - This is clear

- **Line 535**: "In particular, *xPy* iff *C*({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*}."
  - Clear formal statement

- **Line 535**: "I've been arguing against principles linking preference and choice throughout this paper, but I've mostly accepted that they are tightly connected when there are only two options on the menu."
  - This is clear

- **Line 536**: "Still, without some assumption linking choice and preference, the picture in the previous sections implies nothing about preference, hence it says nothing that contradicts Negative Dominance."
  - Clear logical point

- **Line 536**: "For now, let's assume *xPy* iff *C*({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*}, and I'll return at the end to what happens without that assumption."
  - Good preview of structure

- **Line 537**: "Negative Dominance seems like a very plausible principle if (and I think only if) one thinks that the role of decision theory is to come up with coherence constraints on _preferences_."
  - This is clear

- **Line 537**: "Centering decision theory on preference follows naturally from the idea that values and choices are ultimately grounded in preferences."
  - This is clear

- **Line 537**: "As Lederman argues, preferences about lotteries have to be grounded in something about their prizes, and if preferences are fundamental, presumably they have to be grounded in preferences over their prizes."
  - This is clear

- **Line 537**: "The key response I'm making is that if choiceworthiness is prior to preference, this last step doesn't follow."
  - Clear statement of your position

- **Line 543**: "For instance, the fact that *L*(Jack)(Luke) is better than Danny could be grounded in the fact that Danny is not choiceworthy from {Jack, Danny, Luke}."
  - This is clear

- **Line 545**: "But there are more complicated cases where Lederman's challenge of how to properly ground attitudes to lotteries is more pressing."
  - This is clear

- **Line 556**: "Lederman is right that this needs to be explained, that it should be explained in terms of evaluative features of the prizes (i.e., the programmers), and if the explanation uses expected value, we should explain why expected value matters."
  - Long sentence with multiple clauses. Consider breaking: "Lederman is right that this needs to be explained in terms of evaluative features of the prizes (i.e., the programmers). If the explanation uses expected value, we should explain why expected value matters."

- **Line 556**: "No explanation in terms of the choiceworthiness of some options will work to explain why one lottery is strictly better than another."
  - This is clear

- **Line 558**: "The fact to be explained is that when *L*(Jane)(Dolly) and *L*(Lily)(Suzy) are available, only the former is choiceworthy."
  - Clear

- **Line 560**: "Ms. Jones has four values, and it is indeterminate how they should be balanced."
  - Clear

- **Line 560**: "This means both that she hasn't decided how to balance them, and maybe it is unnecessary, or even inadvisable, to balance them."
  - This is clear

- **Line 565**: "Even though Ms. Jones has not resolved the indeterminacy in her values, the fact that any resolution would mean she prefers the first lottery is enough reason to prefer the first lottery."
  - This is the key insight, clearly stated

- **Line 573**: "Relatedly, we might ask why the fact that Ms. Jones would prefer one lottery to another on any way of balancing her values should mean that she has that preference now."
  - This is clear

- **Line 573**: "Why should features of some other value function, one not her own, constrain what she now values?"
  - Good rhetorical question

- **Line 575**: "My reply is that choice functions are meant to play a certain role, they are meant to guide action."
  - Consider semicolon instead of comma: "...certain role; they are meant to guide action."

- **Line 575**: "But they can't do this on their own."
  - Clear

- **Line 575**: "If *x* and *y* are both in *C*(*S*), and Chooser must choose from *S*, Chooser needs something more."
  - Clear

- **Line 575**: "Chooser needs a *plan*. Ideally she would have what @Gibbard2003 calls a *hyperplan*."
  - Good introduction of the hyperplan concept

- **Line 575**: "A hyperplan *H* is a function that takes a menu of options *S*, and returns a member of *S*."
  - Clear definition

- **Line 575**: "It is a very plausible constraint on *C* such that there is some coherent *H* such that for all *S*, *H*(*S*) ∈ *C*(*S*)."
  - This is clear though technical

- **Line 575**: "I conjecture, though I don't have a complete proof of this, that there are plausible constraints on *H*, similar to Unidimensional Expectations and No Trade-Off, which imply that *H* is coherent only if there is some utility function such that *H*(*S*) is an element of *S* with maximal expected utility."
  - Long sentence but clear. Good to acknowledge the conjecture status.

- **Line 575**: "That's far from a complete argument, but it's the direction I think a reply to Dreier's good objection should take."
  - Appropriate modesty

- **Line 577**: "The other objection also comes from Dreier's work."
  - Clear transition

- **Line 579**: "On this way of thinking, it's natural to reject the assumption with which I started this section, i.e., *xPy* iff *C*({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*}."
  - Clear

- **Line 579**: "What's more plausibly true is that *x* is **determinately** preferred to *y* iff *C*({*x*, *y*}) = {*x*}."
  - Clear modification

- **Line 581**: "For more normal choosers, who have not determined a hyperplan, it indeterminate what their preferences are; the preferences don't exist until (that part of) the hyperplan does."
  - Missing "is": "it indeterminate what"
  - Should be: "it is indeterminate what their preferences are"

- **Line 585**: After fixing "The striking is" to "The striking thing is" or "Strikingly," the sentence is clear

- **Line 585**: "Ms. Jones can rationally select any of the programmers, and this remains true even if any of them improves by ε on any skill, but she cannot rationally choose *L*(Lily)(Suzy) when *L*(Jane)(Dolly) is available."
  - This is clear and captures an important point

- **Line 585**: "The resulting position is one where preferences are largely disconnected from rational choice."
  - Clear summary statement

- **Line 587**: "The position set out in the last two paragraphs is not a compulsory consequence of the arguments in the rest of the paper."
  - Good clarification

- **Line 587**: "We could simply reject Negative Dominance (Goodness) and say that Ms. Jones is indeed indifferent between the programmers."
  - Clear

- **Line 587**: "But we, as theorists, have some options here."
  - Clear

- **Line 587**: "Once we say that preferences are analytically posterior to choiceworthiness judgments, there are a lot of ways to understand what preferences are."
  - Clear

- **Line 587**: "Some important arguments, like Lederman's, are not quite arguments against a particular view of choice, but the conjunction of that view with a way of understanding preference."
  - This is an important dialectical point, clearly stated

- **Line 587**: "It could be we're best off simply understanding preference a different way."
  - Clear conclusion

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Engagement with Lederman**: This section does an excellent job of engaging seriously with Lederman's challenge. You take his objection seriously while showing how your framework can respond.

- **Two objections**: The structure of presenting Lederman's main objection followed by two further objections from Dreier is clear.

- **Programmer example**: The four-programmer example effectively extends the earlier secretary example and shows how your framework handles more complex cases.

- **Numbered explanation**: The four-point explanation (lines 560-563) is clear and well-structured.

- **Hyperplan concept**: The introduction of Gibbard's hyperplan concept is helpful and opens up new theoretical possibilities.

- **Modesty**: Appropriate modesty about the conjectural nature of some claims (line 575) and about not offering "a complete argument."

- **Dialectical sophistication**: The final paragraph shows sophisticated understanding that arguments often target conjunctions of views rather than single theses.

- **Errors**: Main issues are "permissible only balancings" (line 561), "The striking is" (line 585), and missing "is" in line 581.

- **Overall**: This is a strong section that handles complex objections while maintaining clarity. The engagement with Lederman and Dreier is philosophically sophisticated.
