# Section 6: Properties of Choice Functions (lines 137-173)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 139**: "etc, that these terms" - Missing period after "etc" 
  - Should be: "etc., that these terms" or "etc. that these terms"
  
- **Line 141**: "I'll start by laying six properties" 
  - Should be "laying out" not "laying": "I'll start by laying out six properties"
  
- No other typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 139**: "In philosophy we're sufficiently familiar with possible properties of preference relations, e.g., that they are transitive, reflexive, acyclic, etc, that these terms don't need to be defined."
  - This sentence is a bit unwieldy with "that...that". Consider: "In philosophy, we're sufficiently familiar with properties of preference relations (transitivity, reflexivity, acyclicity, etc.) that these terms don't need defining." or break into two sentences.

- **Line 139**: "We're mostly less familiar with properties of choice functions."
  - "mostly less" is slightly awkward. Consider: "We're generally less familiar with properties of choice functions." or "Properties of choice functions are less familiar."

- **Line 139**: "A choice function takes a set of options as input, and returns a non-empty subset of that set as output."
  - Consider removing the comma: "A choice function takes a set of options as input and returns a non-empty subset of that set as output."

- **Line 141**: "I'll start by laying six properties that choice functions may have which will be important in what follows."
  - As noted, should be "laying out"
  - Also somewhat awkward. Consider: "I'll start by presenting six properties of choice functions that will be important in what follows." or "I'll present six important properties that choice functions may have."

- **Line 146**: "That is, if *x* is choiceworthy in a larger set, then it is choiceworthy in any smaller set it is a member of."
  - Could be tightened: "That is, if *x* is choiceworthy in a larger set, it remains choiceworthy in any smaller set containing it."

- **Line 151**: "Intuitively, if *x* and *y* are ever both choiceworthy, then anything better than *x* is also better than *y*."
  - This intuitive gloss is helpful, though "ever" might be slightly informal. Consider: "Intuitively, if *x* and *y* are both choiceworthy together, then anything better than *x* is also better than *y*."

- **Line 156**: "This is sometimes called *expansion*, e.g., by Hervé @Moulin1985."
  - Consider: "This is sometimes called *expansion* (e.g., by Hervé @Moulin1985)." (Parentheses might work better)

- **Line 161**: "This is a weakening of β. It says that if *x* and *y* are both choiceworthy in the smaller set, then after options are added, it can't be that only one of them is the only choiceworthy option remaining."
  - "only one of them is the only" is redundant. Consider: "It says that if *x* and *y* are both choiceworthy in the smaller set, then after options are added, it can't be that *y* alone is choiceworthy." or "...it can't be that only *y* remains choiceworthy."

- **Line 161-162**: "If *x* is not choiceworthy in the larger set, that's because some other option, not *y*, is chosen in place of it."
  - This clarification is helpful

- **Line 166**: "If *x* is an unchoiceworthy member of *S*, then it can only become choiceworthy by deleting choiceworthy members of *S*, not other unchoiceworthy ones."
  - "not other unchoiceworthy ones" could be clearer. Consider: "If *x* is an unchoiceworthy member of *S*, it can only become choiceworthy by removing choiceworthy members of *S*, not by removing other unchoiceworthy members."

- **Line 171**: "The same options are choiceworthy from a union of two sets as are choiceworthy from the union of the choiceworthy members of those sets."
  - This is clear but could be tightened: "The choiceworthy options from a union of two sets equal the choiceworthy options from the union of each set's choiceworthy members."

- **Line 171**: "This is a sort of independence of irrelevant alternatives principle; the availability or otherwise of unchoiceworthy members of *S* and *T* doesn't affect what should be chosen from *S* ∪ *T*."
  - "or otherwise" is a bit informal. Consider: "This is a kind of independence of irrelevant alternatives principle; the presence or absence of unchoiceworthy members of *S* and *T* doesn't affect what should be chosen from *S* ∪ *T*."

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Opening contrast**: The opening effectively contrasts familiar preference properties with less familiar choice function properties. This motivates the detailed exposition that follows.

- **Structure**: The presentation of six properties in parallel format (formal definition followed by informal explanation) is excellent and very clear. This is pedagogically strong.

- **Informal glosses**: The informal explanations after each formal property are generally helpful. Property β's intuitive explanation (line 151) is particularly good.

- **Alternative names**: Noting alternative names (Chernoff condition, contraction consistency, expansion) is helpful for readers familiar with other literature.

- **Property naming**: The shift from Greek letters (α, β, γ, δ) to "Aiz" and then "Path Independence" might seem inconsistent to readers. Consider briefly explaining why Aizerman's property doesn't get a Greek letter (presumably because it was introduced later and the Greek letter naming was already established).

- **Technical precision**: The formal definitions are precise and consistent. Good use of set notation throughout.

- **δ vs β relationship**: You note that δ is a weakening of β, which is helpful. Readers might also benefit from knowing whether any of the other properties entail or are entailed by others.

- **Forward reference**: The final sentence (line 173) effectively signals that these properties will be discussed in detail later, which helps readers understand they don't need to fully digest everything now.

- **Missing: practical examples**: While the formal definitions are clear, concrete examples might help readers understand what violations of these properties would look like in practice. However, this may be addressed in subsequent sections.

- **Connection to previous sections**: Consider adding a sentence connecting this to the earlier discussion of Sen's preference relations, since these choice properties will presumably relate to preference properties like transitivity.
