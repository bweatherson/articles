# Section 1: Introduction (lines 64-66)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- No typos or spelling errors detected
- Grammar is correct

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- **Line 66**: "I'm going to argue against this for two reasons" - "this" is clear from context (refers to the assumption that norms about preferences are prior)

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 64-65**: "A common assumption, at least implicitly, is that norms about preferences are prior to norms on values and choices."
  - Suggestion: Consider "A common assumption—often implicit—is that norms about preferences are prior to norms on values and choices." (Dashes can improve flow over commas)

- **Line 66**: "First, preferences, being binary comparisons, don't provide a rich enough base to ground all the norms."
  - Suggestion: "First, preferences—as binary comparisons—don't provide a rich enough base to ground all the norms." (More concise)

- **Line 66-67**: "Sometimes decision theorists need to take as primitive comparisons the chooser (hereafter, Chooser) makes between larger sets of options."
  - This is somewhat awkward. Suggestion: "Sometimes decision theorists need to take as primitive the comparisons that Chooser makes between larger sets of options." 
  - Alternative: Move "(hereafter, Chooser)" earlier in the sentence for better flow

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Strong opening**: The first paragraph effectively establishes the traditional view before pivoting to your critique

- **Transition to reasons**: The "for two reasons" structure is clear, but consider whether the two reasons are sufficiently parallel in structure. The first is about what preferences can ground (richness), the second is about temporal priority (ex post vs ex ante). You might add a brief phrase to signal this distinction more clearly.

- **Reference to future section**: The reference to @sec-multieq works well to signal where the ex ante/ex post distinction will be clarified

- **Minor clarity suggestion**: Consider adding a brief phrase about what you mean by "binary" in line 64. You define it as "binary comparisons" later, but readers unfamiliar with Sen's work might benefit from a quick clarification that this means "based on pairwise comparisons" or similar.
