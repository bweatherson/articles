# Section 13: Aizerman's Property (lines 271-289)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- **Line 277**: "Further, let *C*(*S*) is the set of Pareto-optimal members of *S* relative to those orderings."
  - Grammatical error: "let *C*(*S*) is" is incorrect
  - Should be: "Further, let *C*(*S*) be the set of Pareto-optimal members of *S* relative to those orderings."

- **Line 279**: "For any *C* that satisfies α and Path Independence, there is some set of total orderings over *S* such that *C*(*S*) is the set of Pareto optimal members of *S* according to that set of orderings."
  - "Pareto optimal" vs "Pareto-optimal" - inconsistent hyphenation. Choose one and use consistently (line 277 has "Pareto-optimal" with hyphen)

- **Line 292**: "Let's go back to why we might have wanted to focus on binary preference relations. One natural reason is that our primary aim in looking at preferene is to explain trade"
  - Typo: "preferene" should be "preference"

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 273**: "The property Aiz is not particularly intuitive. Fortunately, it turns out to be equivalent, given our assumptions, to one that is: Path Independence."
  - This is effective and clear

- **Line 275**: "Note that this isn't just saying that the options choiceworthy from the union are choiceworthy from one of the members."
  - This is clear

- **Line 275**: "That is implied by α."
  - Clear and concise

- **Line 275-276**: "What it is saying is that whether the unchosen options from S and T are or aren't on the menu doesn't make a difference to which options are choiceworthy from the union."
  - Consider: "What it says is that the presence or absence of unchosen options from *S* and *T* doesn't affect which options are choiceworthy from the union."
  - Note: Should *S* and *T* be italicized here for consistency?

- **Line 277**: "There is a very natural kind of model where α and Path Independence holds, but β and γ do not."
  - Subject-verb agreement issue: "α and Path Independence" is plural, so should be "hold" not "holds"
  - Should be: "There is a very natural kind of model where α and Path Independence hold, but β and γ do not."

- **Line 277**: "Let *O* be a set of total orderings of *U*. (A total ordering is a relation *R* such that *xRy* ∨ *yRx* ∨ x=y.)"
  - The definition is helpful. Consider whether "x=y" should be italicized (*x*=*y*) for consistency.

- **Line 277-278**: "That is, it is set of members of *S* such that no other member of *S* is better according to every member of the set of orderings."
  - Missing article: "it is set" should be "it is the set"
  - Should be: "That is, it is the set of members of *S* such that no other member of *S* is better according to every member of the set of orderings."

- **Line 281**: "Given that *U* is finite, this turns out to be unsurprising."
  - "turns out to be unsurprising" is slightly awkward. Consider: "Given that *U* is finite, this is unsurprising." or "...this follows naturally."

- **Line 281-282**: "Any semiorder with a finite domain, and hence any such weak order, is such that there is some set of total orders such that *x* is strictly preferred to *y* in the semiorder iff it is preferred in all the total orders."
  - This is a complex sentence. Consider breaking it up: "Any semiorder with a finite domain (and hence any such weak order) can be represented by a set of total orders: *x* is strictly preferred to *y* in the semiorder iff it is preferred in all the total orders."

- **Line 283**: "If *C* is determined by a set of orders in this way, it is said to be **pseudorationalizable**."
  - Clear introduction of terminology

- **Line 283**: "These choice functions are not always binary."
  - Clear and direct

- **Line 283-284**: "Consider one simple example, where *U* is {*x*, *y*, *z*}, *C*(*U*) = {*x*, *z*}, and for any other *S*, *C*(*S*) = *S*."
  - This is clear

- **Line 284**: "That is the choice function determined by the pair of orderings *x* ≻ *y* ≻ *z* and *z* ≻ *y* ≻ *x*."
  - Clear example

- **Line 286-287**: "In this approach we find a set of utility functions and say *xRy* iff *u*(*x*) ≿ *u*(*y*) for all *u* in the set."
  - This is clear

- **Line 288**: "I'm going to argue over subsequent sections that this is a coherent choice function, and hence not all coherent choice functions are binary."
  - Good preview of the argument to come

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Opening strategy**: Effectively introduces Aiz by noting it's not intuitive but equivalent to Path Independence, which is more intuitive.

- **Pareto-optimal model**: The introduction of the Pareto-optimal model is important and clearly explained. This provides the technical machinery for much of what follows.

- **Example**: The simple three-element example (lines 283-284) is very helpful for concretely illustrating the concepts.

- **Connection to multi-utility**: The connection to the multi-utility approach (lines 286-287) is valuable for readers familiar with that literature.

- **Forward momentum**: The final sentence effectively sets up that you'll defend this approach in subsequent sections.

- **Technical precision**: Generally good technical precision, though with the grammatical errors noted above.

- **Footnote**: The footnote about Moulin is appropriately placed and helpful.

- **Finite domain assumption**: Good to explicitly note the role of the finiteness assumption (line 281).

- **Missing**: You might briefly explain why this model is "natural" (line 277) - what makes it natural beyond mathematical convenience?
