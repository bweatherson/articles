# Section 12: Properties γ and δ (lines 259-269)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- No typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 261**: "Assume *R* does not satisfy trichotomy, but is a semiorder, and *C* = *B*(*R*)."
  - This is clear

- **Line 261**: "Then β will fail, but γ and δ will hold."
  - This is concise and effective

- **Line 261**: "Conversely, for any *C* where γ and δ hold, there is a semiorder *R* such that *C* = *B*(*R*) [@Sen1970sec 320]."
  - This is clear

- **Line 261**: "We're not going to be very interested in δ, but we will be very interested in γ."
  - "very interested" (repeated) is slightly informal. Consider: "We won't focus much on δ, but γ will be central to what follows." or similar

- **Line 263**: "The reason γ holds when *R* is a semiorder and *C* = *B*(*R*) is instructive."
  - Good framing

- **Line 263-264**: "If *x* is choiceworthy among *S*, then nothing in *S* is better than *x*. Similarly, if *x* is choiceworthy among *T*, then nothing in *T* is better than *x*. So nothing in *S* ∪ *T* is better than *x*. So *x* is choiceworthy among *S* ∪ *T*."
  - This argument is clear and well-structured. The step-by-step reasoning is pedagogically effective.

- **Line 265**: "Conversely, if there are cases where *C* should not satisfy γ, then we'll have an argument that *C* should not be based in some semiorder *R*."
  - "based in" is slightly unusual. Consider: "based on" or "grounded in"

- **Line 267**: "We had two kinds of counterexamples to β, but only one of them will be relevant here."
  - This is clear

- **Line 267**: "I don't think there are any intuitive counterexamples to γ that start with Fechner-style reflections on the intransitivity of indifference."
  - This is clear

- **Line 267-268**: "But there are going to be variations on the bicycle and pony example that generate intuitive counterexamples to γ."
  - "bicycle and pony" - was it bicycle and bell earlier? Check consistency. (Actually, checking back, you mentioned "boy, bicycle, and bell" in line 255, and "pony" doesn't appear there.)
  - This seems like an error: should probably be "bicycle and bell" not "bicycle and pony"

- **Line 269**: "It is common to say that when *C* = *B*(*R*) for some semiorder *R*, that *C* is **rationalizable**, and when *R* is a partial order, that *C* is **rationalizable by a partial order**."
  - The double "that" makes this awkward. Consider: "It is common to say that when *C* = *B*(*R*) for some semiorder *R*, *C* is **rationalizable**, and when *R* is a partial order, *C* is **rationalizable by a partial order**."

- **Line 269**: "I find this terminology tendentious - why should semiorders be the only things that can make *C* rational?"
  - Good critical observation

- **Line 269**: "And as we'll see in @sec-games, it conflicts with the notion of a choice being *rationalizable* in game theory."
  - Effective forward reference

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Structural clarity**: The section effectively establishes the relationship between γ, δ, and semiorders, setting up why γ violations would be significant.

- **Pedagogical approach**: The step-by-step argument for why γ holds (lines 263-264) is excellent—very clear reasoning.

- **Strategic positioning**: You effectively explain which counterexamples will and won't be relevant going forward, helping readers focus.

- **Terminology discussion**: The final paragraph's discussion of "rationalizable" is important for avoiding confusion with game theory terminology. This is a valuable clarification.

- **Error alert**: The "bicycle and pony" reference appears to be incorrect—should likely be "bicycle and bell" based on the earlier reference.

- **Forward references**: Good use of forward references (@sec-badcomp, @sec-games) to signal where these ideas will be developed.

- **Connection**: The "Conversely" in line 265 effectively sets up the paper's argumentative strategy: find counterexamples to γ, thereby undermine the semiorder grounding of choice.

- **Brevity**: This is an appropriately brief section that serves mainly to set up the argument to come. It doesn't overstay its welcome.
