# Section 19: Multiple Attributes and Decisiveness (lines 393-403)

## 1. Typos, Spelling, and Grammar
- No typos or grammatical errors detected

## 2. Unclear Pronouns
- All pronouns are clear from context

## 3. Sentence Clarification/Shortening
- **Line 395**: "@Sartre1946 has a famous example of a young man, we'll call him Pierre, caught between two imperatives."
  - Consider: "@Sartre1946 has a famous example of a young man (we'll call him Pierre) caught between two imperatives." (Parentheses might work better)

- **Line 395**: "The actual example Sartre gives is complicated in interesting ways, but we'll work with a very simple version of the story."
  - This is clear

- **Line 397**: "The case is horribly underdescribed, but the following verdicts have seemed plausible to many people."
  - "horribly" is perhaps too strong/informal. Consider: "The case is severely underdescribed..." or "The case is deliberately underspecified..."

- **Line 397**: "First, Pierre can rationally, and morally, choose either option."
  - This is clear

- **Line 397**: "Second, and this follows from the first and the fact the case is underdescribed, the options are not equally good."
  - Missing "that": "the fact that the case is underdescribed"
  - Should be: "Second, and this follows from the first and the fact that the case is underdescribed, the options are not equally good."

- **Line 399**: "A third intuition is more contentious, but perhaps plausible: there is something wrong about Pierre going back and forth between the two choices; he should make a choice and stick to it."
  - This is clear

- **Line 399**: "On this view, there is something intrinsically good about settling on a choice and sticking to it."
  - This is clear

- **Line 399**: "What makes this intuition less than fully clear is that in any practical version of the case, it will be very bad for Pierre to oscillate between the two views."
  - Consider: "What makes this intuition less than fully clear is that oscillation would be practically bad in any realistic version of the case."

- **Line 399**: "He could spend the whole war travelling between England and France as he changes his mind on where he should be, and that would be bad."
  - Consider: "traveling" vs "travelling" for spelling consistency

- **Line 401**: "A very simple model for these intuitions is that Pierre's situation is surprisingly like the person playing @tbl-nice-demon."
  - This is clear and makes an important connection

- **Line 401**: "There are two good values here, caring for family and caring for country, and Pierre's fundamental choice is to adopt one of these as his value."
  - This is clear

- **Line 403**: "It is easy enough to reject the third intuition."
  - Clear transition

- **Line 403**: "Perhaps Pierre could rationally, as @Chang2024 puts it, _drift_ into one choice."
  - Good use of Chang's terminology

- **Line 403**: "Still, if one holds all three intuitions, toy models like @tbl-nice-demon capture a surprising amount of what's going on with Pierre."
  - This is clear

## 4. General Clarity and Connection
- **Famous example**: The Sartre example is well-chosen and will be recognizable to many philosophers. Good choice to simplify it for present purposes.

- **Three intuitions**: The structure of presenting three distinct intuitions is clear and effective.

- **Connection to earlier material**: The connection back to @tbl-nice-demon (line 401) is excellent and shows how the formal machinery applies to a real philosophical case.

- **Chang's work**: Good engagement with Chang's recent work on commitment and drift.

- **Contentious claim**: You appropriately flag that the third intuition is contentious (line 399), showing awareness of where your position might be resisted.

- **Footnote**: The footnote about Moss and Holton adds helpful nuance about the temporal dimension of reconsideration.

- **Openness**: The acknowledgment that one can reject the third intuition (line 403) shows appropriate philosophical humility.

- **Missing article**: The error "the fact the case" needs "that" inserted.

- **Pedagogical value**: This section effectively bridges from abstract game-theoretic examples to a concrete philosophical case that readers can engage with intuitively.
