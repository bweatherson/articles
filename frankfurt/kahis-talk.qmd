# Big Claim

Knowledge is sensitive to interests.

Two people alike in all other relevant respects, but with different interests, have different knowledge.

# Schematic Argument

1. One isn't taking an unacceptable epistemic risk by starting an inquiry with what one knows.
2. For almost anything we purport to know, there are some inquiries where it would be unacceptably risky to start with that, purported, knowledge.
3. We know a lot.
4. Therefore, what we know must vary between inquiries.

# Example

Let *p* be the following proposition:

- Frankfurt am Main airport is the busiest airport in Germany; i.e., it has the most passengers per year.

We all know that *p* is true.

# An Old Argument

Ansgar is offered the following bet, take it or leave it.

- If he takes the bet and *p* is true, a child somewhere gets a moment's happiness, like from a game of peek-a-book.
- If he takes the bet and *p* is false, all of humanity is cast into The Bad Place for all eternity.
- If he declines the bet, nothing happens.

# An Old Argument

1. Ansgar should decline the bet.
2. If offered a bet, and Ansgar knows taking the bet will be better than declining the bet, Ansgar should take the bet.
3. If Ansgar knows that *p*, Ansgar knows taking the bet will be better than declining the bet.
4. Therefore, Ansgar does not know that *p*.

# Continuing the Argument

5. Someone with Ansgar's evidence who is not facing, or thinking about, bets like this, knows that *p*.
6. Therefore, what one knows depends on what kinds of bets one is facing, or thinking about.

# Two More Conclusions I Reject

This kind of case shows that knowledge is particularly sensitive to the **practical** interests of the (would-be) knower.

I reject this for two reasons.

1. I'm not sure how much this case *shows*. We'll come back to this.
2. The case need not be practical.

# A Theoretical Version

- Imagine Ansgar isn't actually facing this bet.
- But for whatever reason, perhaps because he's a philosopher, he's thinking about what he would do if he were offered it.
- In that purely hypothetical inquiry, he should still decline, so he still doesn't know.

# Two More Conclusions I Reject

The other conclusion that's sometimes drawn from cases like this one is that knowledge goes away in **high stakes** cases.

This is not right for two reasons.

1. It turns out to be very hard to articulate what the stakes are in cases where there are more than two options.
2. We can get similar results in relatively low stakes cases.

# Red-Blue Game

Willian is playing a game show on TV. One of the games has the following rules.

- Two sentences will be written on the board.
- One will be red, the other will be blue.
- The player has to choose a sentence, red or blue, and say whether it is true or false.
- If they say the correct truth value, they win â‚¬50. If they say the incorrect truth value, they win nothing.

# Another Argument

1. It is irrational for Willian to play Blue-True; the only rational play is Red-True. Any other play is silly (the false options) or needlessly risky (Blue-True).
2. If there is an option that Willian knows gets the maximum possible payout, it is rationally permissible to take that option.
3. If Ansgar knows that *p*, Ansgar knows that Blue-True will get the maximum possible payout.
4. Therefore, Ansgar does not know that *p*.

# Two Observations

- This argument does not rely on extreme cases involving crisis situations, where intuitions might easily go astray.
- If this argument works, the argument for interest-relativity need not involve **high** stakes. 

# Odds and Stakes

It's the odds, not the stakes that matter.

Choosing to play Blue-True over Red-True is a risk with no upside, so it's an infinitely long odds bet.

# Overview

- So far I've set out the main argument for the interest-relative view.
- Next I want to go over some alternative positions, ones that offer responses to the argument.
- I'll close by placing some of these views, and this interest-relative view, in historical context.

# Four Families of Views

I'll describe these more on later slides.

1. Interest-relative
2. Sceptical
3. Epistemic
4. Orthodox

# Interest-Relative

This is the view I support.

Ansgar and Willian lose knowledge when they are offered these bets.

# Sceptical

The sceptic agrees with the conclusion of the argument that Ansgar and Willian don't know that *p*.

They reject interest-relativity because they say that even in normal situations, they don't have knowledge either.

I think this view is implausible, but I'll put off arguments for it until the historical section of the talk.

# Epistemicist

By epistemicist, I mean here the combination of these three views:

1. Knowledge suffices for rational action;
2. We know a lot;
3. Knowledge is invariant with changes of interests.

This view is committed to saying that Ansgar and Willian are rational in taking the bet, and playing Blue-True.

# Epistemicist

That's not particularly intuitive, but the best epistemicists have an interesting story about why intuition disagrees with their position here.
