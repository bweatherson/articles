## Thank You!

- To the organisers, for putting this on and inviting me here.
- To Eugenio, for writing such a great book.
- It raises so many questions, and I'm going to briefly talk about one of them.

## A Break

- Eugenio says that the citations in his study fall into two or three clusters.
- Roughly before and after 2000, though maybe with a small cluster around 2000.

## Periodization

Question:

- Can Late Analytic be broken into periods?
- If so, what are they?
- If not, isn't that odd? Pre-1970 there are lots of periods that seem to pop out. Why none after?

## Eugenio's Study in §4.4

Start with the citations in five big journals:

- _Mind_
- _Philosophical Review_
- _Journal of Philosophy_
- _Noûs_
- _Philosophy and Phenomenological Research_ 

for each year from 1980-2020. 

## Eugenio's Study in §4.4

- Turn the citations for each year into a vector, with one dimension for every work ever cited in that timeframe.
- The more similar the years are, the lower the cosine of the angle between those vectors will be.
- This similarity measure is shown in  @fig-eugenio-matrix.

## Eugenio's Study in §4.4

- Each row of that graph is itself a vector. 
- Eugenio looked for clusters within those vectors, and @fig-eugenio-cluster shows what he found.
