## Thank You!

- To the organisers, for putting this on and inviting me here.
- To Eugenio, for writing such a great book.
- It raises so many questions, and I'm going to briefly talk about one of them.

## A Break

- Eugenio says that the citations in his study fall into two or three clusters.
- Roughly before and after 2000, though maybe with a small cluster around 2000.

## Periodization

Question:

- Can Late Analytic be broken into periods?
- If so, what are they?
- If not, isn't that odd? Pre-1970 there are lots of periods that seem to pop out. Why none after?

## Eugenio's Study in §4.4

Start with the citations in five big journals:

- _Mind_
- _Philosophical Review_
- _Journal of Philosophy_
- _Noûs_
- _Philosophy and Phenomenological Research_ 

for each year from 1980-2020. 

## Eugenio's Study in §4.4

- Turn the citations for each year into a vector, with one dimension for every work ever cited in that timeframe.
- The more similar the years are, the lower the cosine of the angle between those vectors will be.
- This similarity measure is shown in  @fig-eugenio-matrix.

## Eugenio's Study in §4.4

- Each row of that graph is itself a vector. 
- Eugenio looked for clusters within those vectors, and @fig-eugenio-cluster shows what he found.

---

![From page 104 of Petrovich (2024)](cluster-screenshot.png){#fig-eugenio-cluster width=100%}

- Three clusters, but the blue seems more connected to the green than the red.

## Observation

- Very few dark cells (in the original matrix) where one is before 1996 and the other year is after 1996. 
- Somewhere between 1996 and 2006, there seems to be a step change here. 
- What could explain that, and does it have a larger historical significance?

## Hypothesis 1: New Gods, New Masters

My memory/gut reaction was that there was a big decrease in how much attention was paid to Wittgenstein, Rawls, Quine, and Davidson around that time.

- But in fact, Quine and Davidson wrote two of the five most pieces most discussed around 2000.
- This is why you go to the tape, not your memory.

## Hypothesis 2: Hot Topic

This seems like a good suggestion for what was distinctive about the 2000s. Examples:

- Non-conceptual content
- Zombies
- Fictionalism
- Vagueness
- Self-locating belief (i.e., Sleeping Beauty)

## Hypothesis 2: Hot Topic

This would explain why the citations in _Analysis_ were distictive circa Y2K, but not these five journals.

The only one which really turns up a lot in these five is non-conceptual content, and the citations in those papers to Evans probably decrease the distinctiveness of the years.

## Hypothesis 3: Technology

So the internet happened. This had many consequences:

- Ease of accessing papers.
- Ease of submitting papers.
- Ease of communicating outside of the journal system.
- Ease of organising/promoting workshops.

This seems like it could be part of the explanation.

## Hypothesis 4: Epistemology

Eugenio suggests that the rise of epistemology is part of the story here.

I'm a little sceptical.

I think what we saw was an increase in work in epistemology _in these five journals_.

## Two Events

1. Ernest Sosa becomes editor of both _Noûs_ and _PPR_, and he moves more or less full time into epistemology.
2. The category of formal epistemology gets invented (i.e., the Formal Epistemology Workshop is launched), and probability based papers start their migration from Philosophy of Science to Epistemology.

## Upshot

Epistemology is better represented than it used to be in journals that are (a) generalist (as opposed to BJPS/Philosophy of Science) and (b) very-high-status (as opposed to Phil Studies/Synthese).

## Possibly Related Transformation

The 'generalist' journals used to do more political philosophy, but by 2000 they have basically left the field.

Elizabeth Anderson's "What is the Point of Equality?" is almost never cited in these journals.

I think this goes to the question of generalist the 'generalist' journals really were/are.

## Hypothesis Five: The 80s.

Something strange happens in the 1980s and through the early 1990s.

- There are many fewer *big* articles.
- That is, articles which immediately get a lot of citation attention, and which keep it for decades afterwards.
- I think that's part of what's going on in the 2000s; the lack of *big* papers means work from that period disappears quicker than it should.

## Work in Progress

- Eugenio looked at **all** the citations in a **few** journals. 
- I'm working on a study that flips that around: looking at a lot of journals (100 in fact), but only looking at their citations of other journals.
- The point is not that what he did is wrong and what I'm doing is right.
- It's that we're both building models, and having more models can give you a better guide than any one model alone.

## My Dataset

- 100 journals indexed by Web of Science, starting in 1956.
- Individual journals often don't appear until later, not least because they didn't all exist in 1956.
- And the citations are just citations to those very journals.

## First Study

- For each year 1956-2015, find 100 highly cited articles.
- Mix of things that were cited a lot at the time, things that have been cited a lot recently, and things that are cited a lot overall.
- That gives 6000 interesting articles.
- Then do the same cosine based study, just looking at citations of these 6000 articles in these 100 journals.

- The rolling average of similarity score to past five years doesn't show a clean break either.

- This graph, same measure but starting in 1995, is more normal.

## A Toy Model

1. Every year there are lots of discussion notes, replies to the latest thing, but these tend to be to papers in the preceding 5-10 years.
2. There should also be a bunch of citations to the big papers from 10-25 years earlier.
3. But the 1980s didn't have those, which had weird effects on the citations for many years after.

## Evidence?

- Start by looking at articles published in the first half of the 2000s, i.e., 2000-2004. 
- By the end of the 2000s, the 15 most cited articles from the first half of the decade were shown in @tbl-early-2000s.

## The 1980s

- Only 3 out of the 15 appear on both lists.
- The overlap consists of two papers by Peter Railton on moral realism, and a paper by Annette Baier on trust. 
- All of them were towards the low end of the top 15.
- Just very few papers from that time became immediate, field-defining, papers.

## Thanks

Once again, thanks to

- The organisers for putting this on.
- Eugenio for writing a book with so many interesting insights, observations, questions, and avenues for yet further research.

Go read the book!
