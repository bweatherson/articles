pd_payoff <- c(4, 0, 5, 1)
stag_payoff <- c(15, 40, 0, 50)

One round of PD then one round of stag

Delete the 16 duplicate strategies (note that duplication requires same row and same column)
Delete the 8 non-equilibria
Maybe, maybe, delete the 3 weakly dominated
8, 12, 17 and 21 are all available equilibria under some update rules
But no update rule I know of gets G is one round stag hunt, and DGGGG even permissible in strategic game.
